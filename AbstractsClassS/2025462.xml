<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;Development of nanoscale materials and devices, and incorporation of these components into full systems, is an important part of addressing global challenges in energy, health, and the environment. However, nanoscale science and engineering often requires the use of complex and expensive tools and facilities for the fabrication and characterization of these materials and devices. This necessitates the support of shared national resources for both basic research in academic institutions and the translation of these discoveries into commercial products by small and large enterprises. As part of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) program, the Southeastern Nanotechnology Infrastructure Corridor (SENIC) establishes a partnership between the Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering, an academic collaboration between North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NCA&amp;T) and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). This national resource provides open access to nanofabrication and characterization facilities and tools along with expert staff support to a growing user community across the southeastern U.S. The SENIC infrastructure will strengthen and accelerate discovery in nanoscience and nanoengineering, addressing important national research priorities including the NSF 10 Big Ideas encompassing topics such as quantum science, convergence research, and biomedical technologies. In addition, because societal and economic needs require a skilled workforce trained in the tools and techniques of nanotechnology, SENIC implements a comprehensive education and outreach program, embedded with lessons in social and ethical responsibility, designed to reach a broad and diverse audience of students, teachers and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;With access to 350 nanotechnology fabrication and characterization tools, SENIC's goal is to provide a one-stop-shop approach, covering both top-down approaches using nanoscale patterning, as well as bottom-up approaches based on nanomaterials synthesis and additive processing. Programs and activities are designed to address user awareness, accessibility, and affordability. SENIC will operate with an interdisciplinary culture where engineers, scientists, physicians, educators, policy experts, and economic development professionals work together with shared access to facilities and tools and a deep understanding of industry opportunities and societal challenges to promote the accelerated translation of invention into innovation. In addition, SENIC will work in partnership with the other sites in the NNCI network to create a research ecosystem that is strengthened by collaboration, sharing of best practices, scholarly interaction, and mutual support. Furthermore, the SENIC partners will work with undergraduate and graduate students, as well as partner with 2-year technical colleges, to produce science and engineering professionals from diverse backgrounds who are ready to meet the global workforce demands of the 21st century. In tandem, our outreach activities, teacher training, and public awareness events will encourage K-12 students, targeting schools and districts with underserved populations, to participate in the STEM pipeline and will help create an informed citizenry that supports the safe and responsible development of nanotechnology. The SENIC societal and ethical implications program will be embedded into our mission and operation, and will address the intellectual, societal, and economic impact of nanoscale science and engineering enabled by the NNCI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
