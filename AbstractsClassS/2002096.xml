<AbstractNarration>The 15th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (CoNEXT) will take place from December 9 to December 12, 2019 in Orlando, Florida. This award assists 15-20 US-based graduate students to attend this conference. Participation in conferences such as CoNEXT forms a central part of the graduate school experience as it provides students with an opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and exposes them to leading-edge research in the field. ACM CoNEXT emphasizes interactions among networking researchers at an international level and attending CoNEXT presents an excellent opportunity for US graduate students to connect with a thriving international research community. As in past years, CoNEXT 2019 will include a special student workshop that will enable students to present and obtain feedback on their work in progress. This award enables students to attend the main conference and associated CoNEXT 2019 workshops and includes an N2Women (Networking Networking Women) event. The program and workshops will expose students to new ideas and allow them to interact with other researchers. These students would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. The travel grant chair is committed to the participation of women and other underrepresented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops. In particular, the student workshop focuses on providing students an opportunity to present their work in progress, receive feedback on their work, and obtain valuable experience in writing and presenting technical papers thus having a positive impact on the quality of their research. The CoNEXT conference has developed into a top-tier international conference, presenting a tremendous opportunity to students to expand their breadth of ideas, research skills, and technical perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
