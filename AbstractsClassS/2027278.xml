<AbstractNarration>The COVID-19 pandemic is quickly making broad changes to American society.  This project surveys the public opinions, attitudes, and behaviors of thousands of Americans in order to map and track the social disruptions caused by the outbreak, economic shutdowns, and responding public policies.  The project will enhance understanding of (1) effectiveness of public policy in changing individual behavior to conform with public health recommendations; (2) the ways in which different forms of public communication create understanding about the pandemic and distribute public health recommendations; and (3) social and psychological stress caused by social distance and quarantine.  The rise of SARS, MERS, H1N1, and COVID-19 underline the need to understand these phenomena – not just the epidemiology of pandemics, but the effective social policies and practices that create positive behaviors and mitigate harms.  This will not be the last event of its kind, but with a thorough understanding of its effects, we can be better prepared for the next one. As such, the findings will inform governmental policies at several levels. It will also inform civic leaders and residents, thus helping all to mount efforts to mitigate pandemics’ effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has quickly disrupted American life. Surveys of opinions and attitudes and behaviors can track both these social disruptions and responses to them. The project utilizes an internet panel of 500 respondents, recruited daily throughout the period of contagion increase, for a total of 7,000 respondents.  The sample is nationally representative, with an oversample of individuals over age 55.  Once the peak number of cases has passed, daily sample size will be reduced to 250 respondents per day, for another sample totaling 7,500.  To ensure representation, the project will utilize quota sampling with post-stratification weighting.  Survey responses will be matched with local health department data, including number of tests, confirmed cases, and fatalities, as well as other policy data, including school closures, gubernatorial announcements and orders, and state-level legislative actions.  By including geographic measures, the project will ensure future researchers will be able to explore how community actions affected respondents’ attitudes, well-being, and public health behaviors.  Findings from the project will inform sociological theories regarding scientific knowledge, inequality, political institutions, community, stress and social trust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
