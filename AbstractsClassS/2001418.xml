<AbstractNarration>In mid-September of 2020, the first of three Southeastern Number Theory Meetings planned for the 2020-2021 academic year will take place.  Either the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC, or Clemson University in Clemson, SC, will host the second meeting on the first weekend of December 2020.  The third meeting is tentatively planned for April 2021.  One of the first or third meetings will take place at Duke University; the other meeting will take place at the Armstrong Campus of Georgia Southern University.  Further information on these meetings including the locations, dates, lists of speakers, lists of participants, and registration information will be linked to the conference home pages as it becomes available: http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html and http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON. The meetings consist of participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. These topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the Southeast. Each meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by mathematicians at all levels including undergraduate and graduate students, and junior and senior faculty. Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the contributed talks. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A primary goal of the Southeastern Number Theory Meetings is to provide members of the number theory community in the Southeast with an opportunity to learn about new and significant research in number theory and to disseminate their own research. Students and junior researchers in the community particularly benefit from the meetings. The meetings strengthen their knowledge base, expose their work to a wider audience, and give them insightful input and feedback from other participants. Funding from the NSF allows the organizers to achieve their goals at a low cost to individual participants. These meetings integrate regional mathematicians into the community who may have little or no funds for professional travel such as graduate students and faculty at institutions that do not award Ph.Ds. The organizers will continue efforts to attract a demographically diverse participant base including women and racial and ethnic minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
