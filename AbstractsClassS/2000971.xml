<AbstractNarration>In the Bay Area, there are currently over 10,000 job openings for electronics technicians.  In addition, the number of electronics technician jobs is projected to grow at a rate of over 20% within the next ten years.  This project aims to meet local workforce needs by developing a new engineering electronics technology program.  This program will be developed in partnership with local industry to ensure that graduates of the program have the knowledge, skills, and competencies needed to meet this critical local workforce need.  The new program has the potential to improve the capacity and quality of the electronics technician workforce in the Bay Area and to serve as a model for building new engineering technology programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will adopt, adapt, and develop courses covering DC and AC circuits, math for electronics, electronics test and measurement, schematic entry, custom cabling, printed circuit board design and manufacturing, soldering and printed circuit board rework, and battery technology. The program will align with the eleven elements of high-quality Career Technical Education programs as outlined by the California Department of Education.  The project will include an intensive student support program and a funded internship and job placement program with integrated support from industry partners.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
