<AbstractNarration>This project at University of Arizona, a Hispanic Serving Institution, aims to serve the national interest by transforming undergraduate mathematics teaching.  It intends to do so by creating positive learning environments that support all students, particularly those from groups that are not yet equitably represented in STEM. As an Institutional and Community Transformation project, it will bring together undergraduate students, STEM peer mentors, mathematics graduate students, and instructional faculty to support one another?s learning. Project components include workshops on Inquiry Based Learning and anti-deficit teaching, summer-bridge Precalculus and Calculus workshops, critical conversations about race and gender in STEM, a Faculty Learning Community, and faculty-led student interviews.  The focus on anti-deficit pedagogy responds to a critical need for STEM instructor professional development that attends to issues related to race and gender. Expected project outcomes include shifts in the instructors? teaching practices, their perceptions of students, and their understanding about how to challenge systemic inequities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project responds to a critical need for research on community-based professional development programs that prioritize undergraduate students from populations that are underrepresented in STEM. The project?s research plan will investigate the impacts of the community learning process on instructors? teaching. Design-based research methods and process evaluation will support implementation of the project activities and interrogate critical design principles, to support design improvements over the award period. The project will examine Inquiry-based Learning practices in classrooms that serve many underrepresented minority students. By adapting the ?teachers as ethnographers method? from Funds of Knowledge research, instructors will participate in critical conversations at the university?s cultural centers and conduct individual interviews with students. These activities will support instructors? development of awareness of relevant social and policy issues that affect their students, their teaching, and the University as a whole. Written reflections and surveys, together with focus-group and individual interviews, will document the instructors? developmental processes. The project has the potential to improve the learning climate, especially for students from underrepresented groups, and develop future change agents to design and deliver equitable teaching. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
