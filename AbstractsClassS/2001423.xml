<AbstractNarration>This award will fund travel by six students to the Clinic on Dynamical Approaches to Infectious Disease Data being held in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The Clinic is designed for participants without substantial experience in scientific computing or in mathematical modeling. Training focuses on how the complex dynamics of pathogen transmission influence study design and data collection for addressing applied problems in infectious disease research. The workshop focuses on training in both mathematical epidemiology and biomedical epidemiology. Each tradition contributes its own distinct set of research methodologies. The training focuses on using models to ask research questions that are fully grounded in the participants? previous experiences.  Participants will learn how to identify which research questions can and cannot benefit from development of a dynamical modeling program. By providing training in both mathematical epidemiology and biomedical epidemiology, the students will be well poised for future research in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

DAIDD 2019 was hosted by the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA) at Stellenbosch University. There were 12 student participants, 5 from the US (supported directly from this grant) and 7 from Africa (supported by SACEMA). The workshop faculty included 3 core faculty of the ICI3D Program and 3 Workshop Faculty, bringing together expertise from across continents. The Clinic included a diverse set of pedagogical approaches including lectures, computer tutorials, discussions, group work, and individual work. Through several of the Clinic exercises and group and one-&shy;on-&shy;one mentorship with DAIDD faculty, each DAIDD participant developed (1) an iteratively refined research question for an infectious disease modeling project, based on their own research projects and interests, (2) a short written proposal for a dynamical modeling approach that would address this research question, and (3) a schematic diagram of the dynamic model they would use to execute the proposed research. An open access, citable repository of pedagogical materials developed through the ICI3D program, including materials developed or refined at DAIDD 2019, is available through the ICI3D Figshare Repository (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3788224).</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/05/2021<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;C&nbsp;Scott</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
