<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by improving undergraduate learning in computer networking and communications courses. To be prepared for jobs in these fields, college graduates must be able to think critically, solve problems, work well with others, and communicate effectively. This project will apply a new approach for teaching computer networking that enables students to learn technical skills and improve employability skills. The teaching approach will combine simulation-based learning, hands-on learning, and project-based learning within a cognitive apprenticeship framework.  This framework describes a learning environment designed to help a novice move toward expertise through guided learning experiences that emphasize cognitive and metacognitive processes and skills.  Students in the redesigned courses will use networking and digital communications simulation software to design real-world networks and will then create a working physical model of the network they designed. Throughout the process, students will practice metacognition, so that they become aware of and can purposefully strengthen their own problem-solving strategies.  It is expected that this teaching approach will prepare graduates for careers in networking and digital communications, and that other institutions will be able to successfully use the approach.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project aims to produce graduates who have the domain knowledge, practical and career readiness skills, and independent problem-solving capability needed for workplace success in computer networking and communications. The research component of the project will examine student progress in: (a) networking and digital communication concept knowledge and practical skills; (b) self-efficacy in networking and digital communications; (c) career readiness competencies level; and (d) higher-order and metacognitive thinking skills. The teaching approach will be implemented in three courses at Hampton University, an Historically Black College or University. Existing survey instruments, including the Student Assessment of their Learning Gains, the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory, and surveys from the STELAR STEM Learning and Research Center, will be used to assess the effectiveness of the approach. This work is expected to contribute to building a highly capable, diverse workforce in the high-demand field of networking and communications. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
