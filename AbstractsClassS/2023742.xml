<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is significant in the areas of robotic applications, precision agriculture, deep learning, environment sensing, and co-robots. Automated harvesting enables the ability to grow healthy and sustainable food, and the long-term market opportunity for agricultural robotics is $150+ B. This project will develop a robotic solution for large “controlled environment” farms, such as glasshouses and outdoor polytunnels. These use capital and labor more intensively but require less water (~90% reduction), chemical use (~50-70% reduction), and fertilizer use (~50% reduction). Robots could reduce the required labor and enable competitive operations with lower impact on the environment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the fields of computer vision/machine learning and robotics controls by solving frontier problems faced when operating in highly dynamic, precision-requiring biological environments like farms. By evolving and combining approaches from the forefront of computer vision, the project will develop a novel approach to temporospatial tracking of specific fruit as it moves and changes over time, gathering data of unprecedented detail on plant life cycle. Using that plant-level database, the project will integrate visual data to test and refine detection and modeling of berry ripeness. Lastly, the project will integrate in-field spectrometry into ripeness classification. These objectives will underpin a novel precision agriculture solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
