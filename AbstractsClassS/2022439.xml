<AbstractNarration>The United States has historically been the global leader in the interdisciplinary field of the learning sciences, which involves the study of teaching and learning in contexts ranging from children learning math in school, to adults learning highly technical jobs in the workforce. Research in the learning sciences draws from diverse methodologies and domains, including the fields of psychology, sociology, linguistics, design studies, cognitive science, and computer science. The preeminent conference in this field is the International Society of Learning Sciences Conference (ICLS). At this conference the latest research is presented and practitioners learn the state of the art techniques that support the research and design of learning interventions, integrated with advanced technologies. This project supports a Doctoral Consortium and Early Career Workshop for approximately 10-20 attendees, providing opportunities for the participants to interact with international researchers and practitioners. The conference and related activities will address important challenges associated with the transformation of education and broadening of participation in the digital age. The conference will be held virtually this year due to Covid-19. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building upon prior ICLS conferences, several activities and mentoring for participants will be included-  both before, during and after the conference. Prior to the conference, doctoral consortium participants will interact with assigned mentors to discuss research interests and prepare a research presentation covering dissertation progress. During the workshop, they will share this presentation in an interactive format, facilitated by the mentors. After the conference, activities will include online discussions to extend the workshop experience. Activities for the Early Career Workshop are similar, but with a focus on community building and professional development, including mentoring regarding tenure and career path. All participants will interact with a career panel, journal editors, and with each other in a virtual reception. The activities are important to build capacity and support new researchers in the interdisciplinary areas of the computer and learning sciences, supporting participants who then go on to mentor graduate students and other junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
