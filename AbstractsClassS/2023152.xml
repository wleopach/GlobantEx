<AbstractNarration>To support the retention of recent undergraduates during a gap year, the GEO-Bridge program proposes the development of a post-baccalaureate bridge program, which brings together six Monterey Bay institutions to provide gap year students research and, professional development opportunities in geoscience. California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) with a strong undergraduate research program, serves as the hub of this geoscience bridge program. In addition to working with faculty at CSUMB, we will place participants at five partner institutions: Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University (Hopkins), the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML), Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), and Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (ESNERR). Geo-Bridge provides a model for the geoscience community on how to cast the geosciences within the cultural value system of underrepresented groups and support post-baccalaureate students with no research experience. A rigorous summative and formative evaluation plan will help the project team identify gaps in participantâ€™s understanding of geoscience and, assist them in taking lessons learned to continue to improve Geo-Bridge. Beyond providing participants with guidance on how to pursue academic and professional careers in geoscience, the Geo-Bridge program can help them understand how their talents and perspectives, can contribute to a scientific workforce that looks to address the emerging needs of 21st century geoscience research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The social context of the proposed program is the demographics of the U.S, whose composition is rapidly changing, with little reflection of this change seen in the ranks of geoscience institutions of the U.S. The Geo-Bridge program forms an alliance among geoscience professionals to help recruit, engage and retain underrepresented groups in geoscience through a comprehensive mentoring and bridge program. To meet this need, a vigorous recruitment and outreach effort leverages campus-based resources, connections with diversity-focused programs of professional societies, and the experience of the PI in engaging with individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM. This outreach model will allow the PIs to continue to recruit, engage and retain diverse individuals who can provide the unique perspectives required to engage in 21st century geoscience research. The proposed 22-week summer through fall bridge program leverages the scientific and educational assets of the Monterey Bay region to increase the number and diversity of individuals in geoscience. The program will support training and retention in overlooked populations. To accomplish this goal, the PIs will: 1) recruit 6 recently graduated undergraduates per year, with an emphasis on individuals from underrepresented groups and those with limited STEM research experience; 2) engage participants in research in Atmospheric, Earth, Ocean and Polar Science; 3) provide participants with faculty mentoring; and, 4) provide professional development training for participants to ensure continued involvement in geoscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
