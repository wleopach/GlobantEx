<AbstractNarration>PART 1.  NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will consider a class of complex molecularly branched ionic polymers with various chemical compositions, morphologies and tunable physical properties in order to understand composition-structure-property relationships and enhance ion-group mobility.  These novel ion-containing polymeric materials will be synthesized to contain a high concentration of well-ordered charged groups.  They will be processed into continuous morphologies and investigated by various advanced techniques.  This approach will provide an organized material platform with potentially high and controlled ionic transport, as well as liquid electrolytes with low temperature and mechanical stability.  Such organized multi-functional polymeric materials with controlled continuous morphologies are important for prospective novel solid polyelectrolyte media.  These could offer potential for new lightweight, robust, temperature-stable, and safe batteries to replace current liquid-based batteries.  This research will be integrated with a multifaceted educational program for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as outreach to high school students and the general public to cultivate their interest in nanomaterials and more broadly STEM careers.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PART 2.  TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will consider newly synthesized branched poly(ionic liquid)s with different functional cores, ion species, and degrees of ionization.  The PI's group will explore different chemical architectures to promote various micellar morphologies and their assembly into continuous percolated networks across multiple spatial scales starting from individual macromolecules and extending to the formation of long-range interconnected anisotropic core-shell morphologies.  The project is focused on understanding the role of highly asymmetric compositions of new multicomponent branched ion-containing polymers.  These will be tailored to yield continuous domain morphologies via emergence of long-range and network organization such as expanded interconnected cylindrical and nanotubular micelles.  The general hypothesis of the proposed research is that branched macromolecular architectures with multiple functionalities can be leveraged to mediate the organization of poly(ionic liquid)s and guide their assembly into predictable, percolated morphologies of interconnected domains that are distinct from those normally encountered in discrete nanostructures.  The experimental plan will enable a systematic and predictive understanding of component-structure-property relationships for these complex materials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
