<AbstractNarration>The fourth Industrial Revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, is already transforming the way companies create products. One consequence of Industry 4.0 is the integration of new technologies into manufacturing processes. Examples of these technologies include the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), autonomous robots, and cyber-physical systems.  Given the rapidly changing tools and processes, manufacturers nationwide often struggle to find technicians with the skills needed in these new work environments. An especially critical need exists for qualified automation/robotics technicians.  This project aims to address this urgent need in advanced manufacturing by educating technicians who have mechanical skills, together with knowledge of and skills in emerging robotic technologies. Working with industry and educational partners, Stark State College plans to improve training of automation and robotics technicians who will meet current and future industry demands. Potential societal benefits of this project include an updated, industry-aligned automation/robotics curriculum; a stackable technician educational pathway with lower time to degree; development of low-cost training units that simulate advanced manufacturing environments; and a professional development model to better prepare instructors to train tomorrow's automation/robotics technicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project include increasing capacity to effectively train automation/robotics technicians, improving the quality of technician education by better aligning it to workforce needs, and expanding awareness of advanced manufacturing careers among high school students and thus increase participation in automation/robotics programs at both secondary and postsecondary levels. The project aims to achieve these goals by: 1) updating the automation/robotics program curriculum to include training on Industry 4.0 technologies, such as IIoT; 2) creating a new IIoT-focused educational pathway to support student recruitment and retention from high school through associate degree completion; 3) developing low-cost training units to complement the new pathway and curriculum; 4) conducting IIoT boot camps and workshops to engage high school students; and 5) providing professional development to high school and college faculty to grow teaching proficiency and encourage curriculum adoption. Project deliverables and outcomes will be disseminated through regional and national meetings, publications, and webinars or other online mechanisms. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
