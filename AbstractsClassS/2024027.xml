<AbstractNarration>The Tenth U.S.-Japan Joint Seminar on Nanoscale Transport Phenomena will be held in San Diego, CA on July 19-22, 2020. The seminar provides an international forum for interdisciplinary discussions to identify and disseminate outstanding science and technology issues in the area of nanoscale heat and mass transport phenomena. Topics include heat and mass transport in devices, advanced instrumentation for probing heat and mass transport at small spatial or temporal scales, first principles calculations of thermal transport properties, radiative heat transport at the nanoscale, and phase-change heat transfer. The proceedings and perspectives on promising research directions will be disseminated to the greater thermal sciences community through articles in the archival journal Nanoscale and Microscale Thermophysical Engineering. Participants will consist of a diverse group of scientists and engineers from academia, national laboratories, and industry. It is anticipated that this seminar will enable joint research papers, exchange of students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty, as well as sharing of research facilities between the U.S. and Japan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding and controlling physical phenomena at nanoscale have received tremendous attention in recent years in both US and Japan and around the globe. Prior work in the past two decades has shown tremendous opportunities to engineer materials properties at nanoscale. This joint seminar includes the presentations and discussions on a wide range of fundamental subjects related to nanoscale transport phenomena as well as a broad array of technologies that will benefit from the advancements in thermal sciences. The impacted technologies include energy conversion and storage, nanoelectronic devices, advanced manufacturing, biomedical engineering, and among others. The discussions during the seminar and the publications afterwards are expected to identify important and emerging research areas, educate the community on opportunities and challenges in various technological areas, and foster the interactions between academia and industry. Several focused articles will be prepared to disseminate the expertsâ€™ assessment of new opportunities and future research needs to the broad research community. In addition, the talks in this seminar series will be recorded and made publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
