<AbstractNarration>The oMeso project is a Partner to an Existing Network (PEN) award to the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History to join the openVertebrate (oVert) Thematic Content Network (TCN). oMeso expands upon oVert objectives by using 2D and 3D specimen imaging technologies to facilitate exploration of structural and functional diversity in Mesoamerican reptiles and amphibians. The unique ecology and geology of Mesoamerica has fostered the rapid evolution of multiple species adapted for a variety of habitats and life modes. Computed tomography (CT) scans of internal anatomy paired with high resolution photos of external traits will provide complimentary image datasets to create a novel resource for one of the worldâ€™s most hyperdiverse regions. Increased access to digital vouchers generated by oMeso will enable research spanning multiple disciplines, from evolutionary biology and ecology to biomechanics and conservation science. The project provides inclusive training opportunities for university students in curation, data dissemination, and cutting-edge museum technologies. Beyond its research value, the oMeso PEN aims to increase scientific literacy and public engagement around Mesoamerican herpetofaunal diversity through a year-long exhibit accompanied by a community lecture, K-12 programming, and open access lesson plans that incorporate project products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;oMeso will increase the taxonomic scope of the oVert TCN by adding 1100 species across 160 genera, additionally filling a phenotypic data gap in the digital biodiversity landscape pertaining to reptile and amphibian media. These data will broadly support analysis of the patterns and processes relating to evolution, adaptation, convergence, and comparative and functional morphology. Extensive regional sampling will drive investigations into ecomorphology along various environmental gradients, and targeting endemic species will uncover rare or cryptic phenotypes such as those belonging to narrowly distributed microhabitat specialists, endangered, threatened and extinct species, and miniaturized taxa found throughout Mesoamerica. oMeso will leverage existing oVert TCN workflows and digital infrastructure to optimize efficiency and standardize products. Roughly 10% of specimens will be prepared with contrast-enhancement to render soft tissue structures in scans. Resulting raw CT tomograms, 3D surface models, and photo-stacked images will be openly disseminated through MorphoSource and Arctos and integrate with iDigBio, linking project media to corresponding source specimen records and extended data products (e.g., genetic sequences, publications, symbionts). oMeso will bring together collaborators from the University of Colorado, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Florida, along with specimen contributions from seven museum institutions to develop this comprehensive and globally accessible whole phenome resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
