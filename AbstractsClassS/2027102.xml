<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The electrical systems that living organisms employ for bio- computations, such as sensing, intelligent responsiveness, and adaptation, require much less power than currently available man-made electronic systems. This project is developing ultralow-power electronic components and systems for signal retrieval, processing, and storage with power consumption comparable to biological systems. The project takes a fundamentally new approach to improving computing efficiency and storage capacity that can form the basis for self-sustained living or hybrid micro-electronic systems. These electronics that have power requirements similar to biology can naturally interface with biological systems, which is important for potential applications in brain-mimic computation, self-sustained microbots, advanced human-machine interfaces, and prosthetics. The interdisciplinary nature of the research provides an excellent platform for outreach and broadening participation in STEM education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Bioinspired electronics, such as sensing, computing, and memory devices, have generated substantial interest because of their potential high efficiency in information retrieval, processing, and storage. Although functional emulation of biological systems has led to many emerging high-performance electronic devices, there is a fundamental difference in the signal amplitude and power requirements. Biological signal processing, such as sensory detection, neural computation, and memory consolidation, uses action potentials (50-100 mV) that approach the thermodynamic limit, whereas conventional electronic systems function with much higher amplitude (&gt; 0.5 V). As a result, the functional emulation of biosystems has not yet reached the ultralow-power information processing found in biosystems, ultimately limiting the integration density or capacity of computation and storage. The goal of the project is to investigate mechanisms and integrate principles in synthetic materials, electronics, and biology to realize computing devices, memory, and sensors that can function at biological-power levels. Borrowing materials and principles from microbes, the general method is to develop hybrid electronic materials, components, and systems. The research team employs specific approaches including: (i) harnessing catalytic principles in microbial systems to lower the functional voltage in electronics, (ii) incorporating bio-derived materials in devices to improve performance, and (iii) creating efficient interfaces between electronics and microbes to enable self-supported systems. These advances are expected to establish the foundation for future ultralow-power information processing, which is fundamentally related to the ultimate computing efficiency and storage capacity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SemiSynBio-II program (NSF 20-518) grant supports research on biological signal processing, such as sensory detection, neural computation, and memory consolidation with funding from the Division of Materials Research (DMR) of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS), the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) of the Biological Sciences Directorate (BIO),the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate (CISE), and the Division of Electrical,Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) of the Engineering Directorate (ENG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
