<AbstractNarration>Gokova Geometry-Topology Conference will be held during the last week of May of each year in Hotel Yucelen's conference facilities in Gokova/Turkey. The annual international Gokova Geometry-Topology Conferences was founded in 1992 with the purpose of creating a lively informal environment where the latest results of Geometry and Topology are discussed by active world-renowned experts and junior researchers along with enthusiastic graduate students. Many junior now-well-known mathematicians of the field got their early international exposure in these friendly conferences. These conferences aim to increase participation of junior researchers and experts from US. Gokova conferences will continue to provide a platform for exchanging ideas between American, European and Asian mathematicians in timely fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus topics for each conference are  determined by the Scientific Committee during the previous year based on the major scientific breakthroughs that occur in the field, and on  availability of outstanding speakers to present them to a broad audience of geometers and topologists. The list of the topics of current interest that the organizers hope to explore via mini-courses and/or lecture series in the next few years include: C. Manolescu's solution of the triangulation conjecture (Manolescu will be giving a minicourse in 2015 meeting); Flexibility phenomena in symplectic and contact topology (Y. Eliashberg, E. Murphy, and collaborators,one of them will be  minicourse); Geometric approaches to mirror symmetry and extensions of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture (D. Auroux, K. Fukaya, M. Abouzaid, T. Ekholm); Corks, surgeries, and exotic 4-manifolds (Akbulut, Yasui, Ruberman); Refined enumerations and knot theory (Cherednik, Goettsche, Shende). More information can be found on the conference web page.&lt;br/&gt; http://gokovagt.org/</AbstractNarration>
