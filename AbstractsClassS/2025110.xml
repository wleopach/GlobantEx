<AbstractNarration>The new generation of senior leaders at U.S. small and medium colleges and universities (SMCUs) recognizes the need to establish a science and engineering (S&amp;E) research culture on their campuses to become more competitive for state and federal funds, to enhance the opportunities for their students, and to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship in support of the national economy. However, their institutions often lack capital and infrastructure resources required to pursue these opportunities. These leaders need a means to identify, recruit, cultivate, and retain innovative faculty to fulfill their research missions. SMCU faculty who want to perform research are often deterred by high teaching loads, in some cases as many as 5 classes per term. Change is needed, especially at minority serving institutions (MSIs) including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) which educate an increasing percentage of the population needed to meet the emerging global challenges to U.S. primacy in science and engineering innovation. With more than 58% of 965,000 S&amp;E doctorates in non-academic positions, the investigators believe there is an opportunity to grow the faculty ranks and equip a new generation to pursue scholarly work at these critical institutions for the benefit of U.S. global competitiveness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Visiting Innovative Scholar Research Program for Institutions Orienting to National Needs (VISION) aims to catalyze sustainable research activity at SMCUs in strategic areas of national concern by disrupting the high teaching loads that impede faculty led research and transferring key practices in teaching, research, and innovation to SMCU leaders and faculty. VISION seeks to ultimately achieve these goals by recruiting, training, placing, and supporting early and mid-career S&amp;E doctoral degree holders to serve as visiting scholars at SMCUs. In this pilot, VISION specifically addresses the national strategic concern to accelerate U.S. research activity and to broaden participation in computing information sciences and engineering (CISE).  The proposed work will establish a cohort of research-oriented, full-time, junior and senior faculty from five minority serving institutions, to serve as VISION Faculty Fellows and the intellectual core for research in CISE fields at their respective schools. Appointments will be for up to two years. Fellows will receive training and mentoring in research program development, teaching and learning, and innovation and entrepreneurship, through the University of  California, Davis, an emerging Hispanic Serving Institution. UC Davis collaborates with VISION through their Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the Graduate School of Management; the Center for Educational Effectiveness; the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion?s collaboration with the Office of Research; and the College of Engineering - where Computer Science is housed. VISION will study the impact of this collaborative model on the Fellows and the research mission of their home institutions. The investigators expect to advance the understanding of the research and teaching needs of MSIs, contribute to the societal goals of accelerating the participation of persons from underrepresented groups in innovative research and teaching in the faculty ranks, and strengthen institutions that train students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
