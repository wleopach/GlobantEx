<AbstractNarration>Professor Marina Petrukhina of the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Division of Chemistry to study a diverse set of nanocarbon materials with inherent curvature and twist. Nanocarbon materials are increasingly being used in a range of applications, particularly as electrodes in alternative energy generation and storage systems such as Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. It is now generally agreed that the charge storage and transport properties of these materials are highly dependent on the structural features of their molecules and assemblies. The project is poised to advance fundamental knowledge on the chemical and electronic properties of these non-planar molecular nanocarbons. A better understanding of these systems and their multi-electron acquisition and charge transport processes paves the way for their utilization in practical energy devices. Beyond its fundamental importance, a major objective of the project is the enhancement of the educational and research experiences of graduate and undergraduate students at the SUNY Albany to prepare them for future success in a highly competitive workforce environment.  The PI is actively involved in enhancing the infrastructure across the State University of New York (SUNY) campuses to strengthen the research portfolio and to facilitate innovation in nanoscience, sustainability and energy related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is carrying out a broad fundamental investigation of stepwise chemical reduction processes and multi-electron storage capacities of a diverse set of novel nanocarbon materials. The project's three main objectives are: 1) the evaluation of the structural transformations of curved, twisted, and doped molecular nanographenes with different core topologies and pi-conjugation upon addition of multiple electrons; (2) the investigation of the reduction-induced reactivity and utilization of intra- and intermolecular Câˆ’C coupling reactions for the synthesis of new extended polyaromatic systems; and 3) the study of self-assembly and alkali metal intercalation of the highly charged carbon scaffolds with embedded cavities and pockets for the development of new energy-storage materials. The project provides new insights into electron acquisition abilities and reactivity of novel molecular nanocarbons with contorted and strained frameworks, as well as uncovers unusual structural transformations and new coupling pathways upon stepwise build-up of negative charge. By improving the fundamental understanding of the redox properties, self-assembly and alkali metal intercalation processes, the project facilitates practical applications of the nanostructured carbon materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
