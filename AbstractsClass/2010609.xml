<AbstractNarration>This workshop's goal is to identify potential transformational research approaches for the recovery of unconventional oil and gas that would achieve a radical large-scale improvement in the recovery factor and much reduced environmental impacts. This would be accomplished by changing hydraulic fracturing. This workshop is based on the understanding that the recovery of hydrocarbons from unconventional resources, led by the US, has drastically changed the world and continues to be important to the US and the world. This relatively new source of gas and oil has required horizontal drilling and intensive hydraulic fracturing. Although many improvements have occurred, hydraulic fracturing technologies remain inefficient. The recovery factor continues to be low, less than ten percent of the hydrocarbon liquids in place. This leads to substantial environmental impacts as massive amounts of water and sand are injected to create the required formation surface area for production. The volumes of water required and the mass of sand injected per barrel of new oil recovered continues to increase. These commodity volumes lead to projections of even higher environmental impacts as oil production increases. A small group of experts from universities, industry, and national laboratories will be convened with a moderator with considerable experience in coordinating innovative brainstorming-type meetings. The discussion and recommendations for research opportunities to achieve a drastic large-scale change will be presented in a Final Report and distributed widely. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defining this research requires vision, as well as strong science and engineering. The challenge mandates multi-disciplinary participation, involving solid and fluid mechanics, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and application fields such as petroleum and mining engineering. Great talent is available within industry, universities, and national laboratories to work the problem; however, what is missing is a focus on the required research opportunities. This workshop will bring together a diverse group of scientists and engineers in an innovative environment to define these research opportunities. It is certain that an approach different from "business-as-usual" is required. Drastic, large-scale change must be considered; however, this will be difficult in the current atmosphere that is based primarily on short-term cost reductions. Radical change will not be easy and will require the joint efforts of industry, universities, and national laboratories. A first step to gain industry support is to define research opportunities that have potential for radical but viable change. Once potential opportunities are defined and vetted by experts drawn from diverse sectors, impactful industry engagement is anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ IIntroduction:  Abundant, low-cost, secure, and reliable energy is critical to the United States. Recent development of unconventional shale oil and natural gas reservoirs has led to this.  In the United States (and worldwide), oil  will continue as a transportation fuel for some time, even as electric vehicles are introduced. Natural gas will be even more important in helping to reduce global carbon emissions for the near- and mid-term. Natural gas will be the bridge that allows the implementation of additional solar and wind electricity while large-scale, long-term energy storage strategies are developed.  Natural gas turbines will be the peaking units to handle the diurnally intermittent nature of solar and wind power.  Public perception regarding production of shale oil and gas seems to be driven by concerns related to environmental impacts. "Hydraulic fracturing" is required for recovery of shale oil and gas. Frac’ing has become a focal point for public disagreement. This project aimed at identifying large scale changes in the methods for hydrocarbon recovery, combining environmental and economic benefits in a mutually beneficial manner. The workshop that was convened for this project was intended to rally support for the development of alternative oil and gas extraction protocols collaboratively by researchers at universities, National Laboratories, and in private industry.  Intellectual Merit:  The NSF program was not driven by the inability of the hydrocarbon production industry to make significant improvements in the recovery of shale oil and gas. Quite the contrary; industry has made significant improvements in operational efficiency. These improvements have significantly lowered recovery costs and also reduced environmental impacts. The conundrum is that in doing this, industry’s strong focus on near-term cost reductions has not allowed progressing toward substantial changes in recovery operations that are needed for the long-term.  The industry has, in fact, been on a treadmill of sorts. Longer wells are being drilled, using more commodities during hydraulic fracturing (water and sand are required). Despite this, there continues a rapid decline in production. This in turn requires drilling more wells to offset the rapid decline, and then drilling more wells, and so forth.  It has become very clear that individual industry participants alone will not move to large-scale, drastic change. Candidly, today, producers and the service industry supporting them likely do not have either the resources or the technical capability to make such a move. It appears that for "business as usual", recovery costs and corresponding environmental impacts will not be lowered enough to meet economic requirements nor to alleviate strong public leanings. In fact, local environmental impacts for each volume of oil or gas recovered may increase.  The recovered percentage of the oil and gas in place &ndash; that is the "recovery factor" -has not significantly increased even as operational efficiency has increased. The recovery factor remains low - maybe only 8-10% for oil and two to three times that for gas. Most of the oil and gas is left in place, even as industry drills up its most valuable properties.   With this background, a workshop was convened with recognized experts from industry, academia, and National Laboratories focusing on three areas for potential large-scale, drastic improvements in how hydrocarbons can be recovered. These three themes were 1) looking for an alternative to augment or replace hydraulic fracturing, 2) considering how to greatly increase the recovery factor and 3) considering how to manage production from lower quality reservoirs since the best properties have or will soon be drilled up. Some highlights are as follows.  Lower recovery costs and lower social and      environmental impacts can go together; if they don’t work together, one or      the other will be a big loser which would not be good for the country. Small hole drilling from the lateral and      pulsed gas fracturing looks interesting and could be an alternative to      pure current hydraulic fracturing. Understanding fluid mobility for closely      spaced shale wells including some form of enhanced oil/gas flow mechanism      could potentially increase the recovery factor two or three-fold. Better understanding of the subsurface      for shale reservoirs could avoid larger efforts per barrel of oil for      lower quality reservoirs.  Any large-scale change will not be easy,      and is likely to be too large for any one company.   Broader Impact  Outreach following the workshop has included a presentations by Sidney Green to the Salt Lake Section of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and a webinar to the American Rock Mechanics Association’s (ARMA) Hydraulic Fracturing Technical Community ["US Shale Oil/Gas Recovery: A Drastic Change is Required"]. Mr. Green will also provide a closed-door Congressional Research Service Seminar discussing technology potential for large change, in September 2020.  Communication continues with participants regarding the Workshop including viability of slimhole drilling and dynamic or pulse fracturing, large-scale change in production including the high early production and enhanced recovery methods, and better reservoir characterization for multi-well geomechanics analysis.
