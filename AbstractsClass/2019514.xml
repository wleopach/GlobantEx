<AbstractNarration>This travel grant provides support for 15 US-based students to attend the 30th Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV) to be held in Los Angeles, California on July 19-24 2020. CAV, one of the premier conferences in formal verification, is dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis and synthesis methods for hardware and software systems. The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US-citizen graduate students. Attending conferences like CAV is an important component of graduate school education for future computer-science researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading-edge research with world-class researchers in formal methods, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers. This project aims at increasing the participation of students from underrepresented groups and those from smaller institutions of education, to provide them with equal opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
