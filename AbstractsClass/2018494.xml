<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Skidmore College is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an automatic sample changer to support Professor Steven Frey and colleagues Raymond Giguere, Juan Navea, Aurelia Ball and Anna Brezny. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and at nearby State University of New York Adirondack Community College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of an NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the characterization of synthesized manganese(II) complexes used as mimics for superoxide dismutase. The instrumentation is also used for characterizing and modulating the small protein homology 3 (SH3) domain binding pathway biophysics. In addition, it benefits the development of methodology for mechanistic studies in organic electrochemistry and for exploring organic synthesis focusing on intramolecular cycloadditions. The spectrometer is also used for studying the role of pH in the aqueous photochemistry of atmospherically-relevant photosensitizers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
