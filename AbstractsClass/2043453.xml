<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by studying ways to prepare a new generation of engineers to join the growing renewable energy workforce. A shift to increased reliance on renewable energy will require a skilled engineering workforce that can develop and promote energy sustainability practices. To help prepare this needed workforce, the project aims to develop engineering students’ environmental awareness across multiple levels, from knowledge acquisition to career decisions. Typically, a change in students’ environmental awareness alone does not translate into workforce development for renewable energy industries. This exploratory research intends to address this gap by offering interventions that target environmental awareness across a diverse group of undergraduate engineering students at Tuskegee University and Auburn University.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to advance understanding of the gap between environmental awareness and behavior, as well as determine the necessary technical competencies and soft skills that sustainable energy industries demand from new engineers.  To do so, this project will: (1) examine the link between engineering students’ environmental awareness and their willingness and preparedness to pursue careers in renewable energy fields; (2) offer mechanistic educational design to maximize sustainability competencies and behaviors; and (3) create a paradigm for building a pipeline between academic institutions and renewable energy and related industries.  This project from two institutions in Alabama features strong associations with relevant industries in the Southeast. Activities intended to support development of a diverse renewable energy engineering workforce include a renewable makerspace, horizontal integration of sustainability concepts in multiple courses, and enhanced university-industry engagement, such as student field trips to industrial sites and feedback from industry representatives regarding workforce needs. A mixed-methods research study will provide insight on the skills and competency levels associated with participation in each intervention. Four components of environmental awareness (knowledge, attitude, willingness, and perceived preparedness) will serve as indicators. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
