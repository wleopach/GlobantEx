<AbstractNarration>Trusted hardware is the foundation of cybersecurity. The International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) is a leading forum for hardware security researchers. This travel grant enables student researchers to attend the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposed activity includes professional development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as continued growth of the symposium. HOST 2020 will be held in San Jose, CA on May 4-7, 2020. This project provides opportunities for 60 students to receive travel support to attend HOST 2020. Their attendance enables them to learn about the latest tools, design methods, architectures, circuits, and novel applications of secure hardware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical contributions from previous symposia have covered topics such as: (1) counterfeit detection and avoidance, (2) side channel analysis and fault analysis, (3) hardware architectures for cryptography, and (4) physically unclonable functions (PUFs). The travel grants encourage more students to consider a technical submission, participation in growing hardware demonstration space to a large diverse audience, or even to attend as a means to prepare for a technical submission in future years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Unfortunately, countless recent stories highlight that security weaknesses in hardware are pervasive, can now be exploited remotely (through software), and are challenging to mitigate. To address these issues, security must be recognized as a fundamental element to be incorporated into the design, manufacturing, validation, maintenance, and upgrade of hardware for all types of systems. New processes that integrate security and trust into design flows and add hardware features to enable trusted execution are complex and require a concerted, multidisciplinary effort. To this end, the mission of the IEEE Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) is (1) to be a leading and globally recognized forum that unites researchers, practitioners, and users from the computer security, microelectronics, and EDA communities; (2) to disseminate cutting-edge ideas, technologies, and results in areas of overlap between hardware and security; (3) to provide a platform for leaders in industry, government, and academia to share their unique perspectives and to help shape the direction and priorities of the community; and (4) to address shortages in the security workforce by recruiting and training students from a diverse group for productive careers with prospective employers.</p> <p>The primary goal of this project was to engage as many students as possible who would attend HOST for the first time and would not normally attend HOST (high school, undergrads, MS students, PhD student who do not have papers, etc.).

The hope is that this will get such students interested in pursuing a PhD in hardware security. A third goal was to put students in touch with as many industry employers as possible. Being one of the premier events in hardware security technology and research, these students who attend HOST will have a chance to talk with senior researchers from government, industry, and academia and to get exposed to the latest research in hardware security. Further, HOST offers many other activities to aid in student professional development, such as (1) Technical Talks, (2) Student Demos and Competition; (3) Student Posters and Competition; and (4) Tutorial Day.

Further, the committee asked the call for applications to be e-mailed by leaders of national groups representing women and minorities to increase their participation. Over two deadlines (one in Spring 2020 and the other in Fall 2020), HOST received over 100 applications.
