<AbstractNarration>Wildfires alter hydrologic processes, accelerate erosion and increase sediment transport rates. In the western U.S, these changes pose considerable risks to downstream infrastructure and ecosystems, and natural resource managers urgently need practical and reliable predictive tools to support post-wildfire management. The active Grizzly Creek wildfire in Glenwood Canyon, CO, presents a unique, time-sensitive opportunity to collect necessary field data to monitor these processes and develop transferable analytical tools. The watershed has active long-term USGS gauges both up and downstream from the study area as well as highly variable topography, land cover and burn severity, making the Grizzly Creek fire an ideal candidate to capture a range of post-wildfire hydrologic responses within the same watershed. Ultimately, this data will directly support and inform post-wildfire management and restoration, which costs tens of millions of dollars across the western U.S. each year. Data collection is in coordination with the USGS Post-Fire Debris-Flow Hazards team to ensure efforts are complementary and support larger hydrologic and geomorphic research efforts. Results will be conveyed to the post-wildfire research and management community through presentations to major stakeholder groups, such as the USFS, NRCS, Utah Division of Natural Resources, water conservation districts, dam operators, and other relevant groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrologic field data collected for this project will support evaluation and improvement of post-wildfire hydrology and sediment dynamics models, as well as advances in fundamental understanding of hydrologic processes. Reasonable hydrologic forcing remains a major limitation of network-scale modeling frameworks to assess post-wildfire sediment dynamics. To fill this gap and improve our understanding of post-wildfire hydrologic response across a watershed requires rapid mobilization to capture the initial response in a recently burned watershed with long-term streamflow records and variable watershed and burn characteristics. Monitoring sites capture similar watershed characteristics (e.g., slope, land cover) along a burn severity gradient, and are paired with nearby analog unburned catchments. Precipitation, streamflow and hillslope infiltration rates will be monitored through time throughout the burned area. This perishable data will be used within a novel analytical framework to answer critical research questions related to variability in the post-wildfire rainfall-runoff response through space and time, beginning immediately following a burn. The research will help determine how the spatial distribution and severity of burned areas within a watershed impact post-wildfire runoff, distributed streamflow response and, ultimately, sediment flux rates. This research will advance long-term sediment transport and storage predictions in this and other emerging modeling efforts that inform resource management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
