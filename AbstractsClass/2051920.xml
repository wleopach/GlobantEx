<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of mental health disorders, specifically, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While PTSD is most commonly associated with military personnel, it is estimated that roughly 7-8% of Americans will suffer from PTSD at some point in their lives resulting from everyday trauma, such as car accidents and sexual trauma. Further, it is anticipated there will be dramatic increases in the incidence of PTSD as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed therapeutics would be most effective as part of an integrative approach to treating PTSD. The proposed innovation is also a fit for the burgeoning complementary and alternative medicine industry. This industry supplements the health needs of roughly 36% of Americans and is estimated to reach $296 billion in global revenues by 2027.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development and testing of novel strains of mycobacteria that may be incorporated into nutraceuticals for public consumption. Mycobacteria have been shown to reduce inflammation and modify the immune system of the brain. These characteristics of mycobacteria have important implications for mental health. Specifically, it has been shown that administration of heat-killed mycobacteria prior to stress enhances stress resilience and prevents stress-induced exaggeration of inflammation, spontaneous colitis, and anxiety in animal models. These effects specifically address two of the main symptoms of PTSD: avoidance and alterations in excitation or reactivity. These symptoms are associated with well-known behaviors in individuals with PTSD, such as irritability, sleep problems, difficulty concentrating, and avoiding experiences associated with trauma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
