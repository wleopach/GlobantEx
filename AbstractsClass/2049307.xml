<AbstractNarration>Changes in ocean life, the environment, and the climate can influence the timing and composition of biological material that sinks to the sea floor. As this material sinks it is consumed by bottom-dwelling organisms such as deep-sea corals. Similar to tree rings, corals preserve a history of growth embedded in their skeletons, which can be analyzed using a new technique called microgeochemistry. This project is compiling a historic dataset from deep-sea corals spanning 50 years in the Gulf of Maine to understand how biological material sinking to the bottom has changed with time. Results from the coral analysis are being compared with archival samples of small planktonic crustaceans, copepods, to better understand the connection between productivity in the surface waters and the geochemical record in the coral tissue. A complementary modeling approach is identifying environmental and climatic drivers of decadal-scale oceanographic change with the sources and transformations of organic matter that connect the surface and the deep ocean. This cross-disciplinary project is unifying transformational research with broader impacts focused on science education and outreach that broaden the understanding of the links between climate, oceanography, and marine ecosystem response using a 50-year historical context. Two open access, media-enhanced, and National curriculum standards-aligned educational lessons plans are being developed through partnerships with a science documentary filmmaker, K-12 teachers from RI and ME, and the PBS LearningMedia Program. The topics of these lesson plans are: 1) Deep-sea exploration: A window into the past and future, and 2) Changing food webs on a changing planet. The project’s educational goals include training of three graduate students, career development of five early career researchers, and research experiences for undergraduates from underrepresented groups in STEM. The multi-faceted research and education effort is addressing a question described as highest priority in the Ocean Sciences by the National Research Council: How are ocean biogeochemical and physical processes linked to today’s climate variability and its variability? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pelagic-benthic coupling regulates ocean production and food webs dynamics, biogeochemical cycling, and climate feedback mechanisms through the export of surface production to the ocean interior. Yet access to long-term data sets of export production are scarce and urgently needed to test assumptions about 1) the sources and transformations of organic matter through different food web pathways, and 2) the variability of these processes across climatic, oceanographic, and ecological changes through time. The proposed work is testing key hypotheses about bottom-up mechanisms that link decadal-scale oceanographic changes in hydrography and biogeochemical cycling with phytoplankton community composition, zooplankton abundance and trophic dynamics, and the resulting composition of export production. Complementary approaches are generating multiple and independent 50+ year, annually resolved time series of phytoplankton community composition, zooplankton trophic dynamics, and export composition.  Coral tissue and archived zooplankton samples are being analyzed using pioneering molecular geochemistry approaches to assess changes in diet related variation in primary production. Deep-sea corals are being collected using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and zooplankton are available through archival samples from a Gulf of Maine long-term monitoring program managed by NOAA. The stable isotope data are being integrated with additional data from existing long-standing ocean monitoring programs and incorporated into a unifying modeling approach to identify unique ecosystem states and their environmental drivers. The project is focused on Jordan Basin in the Gulf of Maine, which has a long history of oceanographic study and is experiencing significant changes due to climate warming, making it an ideal natural laboratory for testing hypotheses on drivers of change in the composition of exported organic matter, and the relative importance of primary (e.g., phyto-detritus) vs. secondary production (e.g., copepod fecal pellets), and large vs. small pelagic plankton dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
