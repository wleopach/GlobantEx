<AbstractNarration>Many of today's mobile services build mobile communities of users who share their valuable experiences and data. Examples include traffic incidents (Waze), restaurant reviews (Yelp, FourSquare), anonymous social networks (Whisper, Yik Yak), and even dating (Tinder, Bumble).  Unfortunately, new threats can compromise and manipulate these communities, using lightweight software to mimic mobile devices.  The researchers have shown how attackers can eavesdrop on mobile network traffic, learn their patterns, and write software to emulate mobile devices running the application. This amplifies existing attacks by multiple orders of magnitude, and allows attackers with limited resources to overwhelm mobile communities using millions of emulated devices under their control. These devices are difficult to detect, and completely cripple entire mobile systems, or manipulate them for the attacker's personal gain.  Preliminary work showed that such an attack on Waze, Google's crowdsourced traffic navigation application, enabled fine grained GPS-level tracking of large user populations. Similar vulnerabilities apply to Yelp, Tinder, Uber, and others, with consequences ranging from manipulating/censoring content, theft of monetary incentives, to completely crippling the service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work described in this proposal seeks a better understanding of the threat of software-emulated devices to mobile communities, and explores systematic defenses against them. The researchers will develop defenses that detect large-scale attacks and limit their impact to that of single misbehaving devices, using three orthogonal approaches: a) a centralized infrastructure-based solution, that uses hidden patterns in aggregate user data to authenticate mobile devices; b) hardware solutions that extracts device-specific sensor data using platform APIs, and compares them to known models of hardware data models; and c) application-level solutions that use unsupervised learning to automatically detect similarity clusters in devices, based on analysis of user behavior (clickstreams) and physical mobility trace.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project seeks to better understand the threat of software-emulated devices to mobile communities, and to explore systematic defenses against them. More specifically, we want to develop defenses that detect large-scale attacks and limit their impact to that of single misbehaving devices, by exploring orthogonal approaches to construct defenses with varying cost/accuracy tradeoffs.  Over a period of three years, we have developed two types of defense solutions, including (1) application-level defenses that develop robust machine learning algorithms to detect fake devices/applications and distinguish them from real devices/applications;  and (2) OS level defenses that secure OS for mobile devices from intentional manipulation to bypass our application-level detectors.     For our application-level defenses, we focus on developing robust deep neural network (DNN) models that capture highly complex behaviors of devices/apps to significantly improve detection accuracy.  The biggest challenge facing our design is that, the lack of transparency of these DNN models makes them susceptible to several attacks, from adversarial inputs to backdoor attacks.  These are practical attacks that have been shown by previous works.   Thus our focus has been developing new DNN design methodologies to detect adversarial input attacks to a model, and to detect and remove backdoors embedded into a model.  Along this line, we have developed  i) robust and efficient defenses that resist adversarial perturbation caused by transfer learning (Usenix Security’2018),  ii) the first robust and general techniques for detection and mitigation against backdoor (Trojan) attacks on DNNs (Neural Cleanse in IEEE S&amp;P 2019),   iii) the first latent backdoor based attack that successfully survives transfer learning and remains undetectable by conventional backdoor defenses,  followed by suggestions on how to defend against such latent backdoors;  and iv) the first honeypot based defense that resists adversarial perturbation based attacks,  where the defense is implemented as intelligently designed backdoors which we call "trapdoors" (CCS’20).  Finally,  in the final year of our project we also applied insights from this project to develop two mobile-related systems that protect user privacy:  a wearable microphone jammer that disables microphone devices nearby (CHI’2020), and a silent reconnaissance attack that a mobile device can track user motion inside a house/office by just by listening to WiFi ambient transmissions of IoT devices at an outdoor location (NDSS’2020).    For our OS-level defenses,  we develop and instrument a new approach toward protecting mobile app secrets against an untrusted OS, called Ginseng (NDSS’2019). Once app secrets can be protected, they can be used to uniquely identify a mobile installation and therefore provide a new way to detect sybils (or simulated) devices.  Ginseng supports third-party apps without growing the attack surface, significant development effort, or performance overhead. We implement a Ginseng prototype using the HiKey board with ARM TrustZone. Combining Ginseng with known tech- niques that secure user input, our prototype is the first to secure sensitive app data for its entire lifetime against an untrusted OS on ARM-based systems, without app logic in the TEE. Ginseng was a finalist for the Distinguished Paper Award at NDSS 2019.  We continue to improve Ginseng in order to relax its assumptions and improve its performance.
