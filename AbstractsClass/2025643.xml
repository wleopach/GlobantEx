<AbstractNarration>This NSF-CASIS project will conduct a series of experiments on board the International Space Station (ISS) and on Earth to understand the role of gravity in the dynamics of mudflows. It is well established that rainfall triggers mudflows on recently burned slopes. After wildfires, the surficial burned soil is water-repellent or hydrophobic, preventing rain infiltration and leading to sudden and rapid mudflows. Post-wildfire gravity-driven mudflows are unpredictable, occur suddenly, and travel rapidly downhill, turning into debris flows and mobilizing large and heavy boulders. In January 2018 in Montecito, California, an intense 15-minute burst turned into a devastating debris flow which caused 21 deaths, led to $421 million in damages, and closed key transit corridors. The experiments will examine how the attachment of hydrophobic soil particles to air bubbles leads to the formation of aggregates that may give rise to the unusual flow behaviors observed in mudflows. Particle-air-water mixtures form interesting structures (bubbles, pipes and clusters) whose shapes are primarily governed by a balance between gravity and the attractive forces between air bubbles and water-repellent particles. The experiments on the ISS and on Earth will use a model system consisting of sand particles that have been made hydrophobic through a chemical treatment, air and water. After mixing, the material will flow through a plexiglas channel, and particle motions and evolution of aggregates will be imaged and correlated with characteristics of the overall flow. By comparing experiments on the ISS with those on Earth, the role of gravity in aggregate formation and flow behavior will be understood. The results of this study will help understand how mudslides are affected by rainfall intensity and duration and could lead to better early-warning systems and risk evaluation. The research team will include students, especially those from underrepresented groups, and the project will support educational activities to high-school students in local communities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to run experiments on Earth and in microgravity conditions to correlate mudflow composition with flow and transport characteristics on a micromechanical level. An understanding of the role of gravity on microstructural changes in flowing air-water-particle mixtures and, in particular, on the formation of particle-bubble agglomerates is crucial for predicting the rheological behavior of mudflows. Experiments will focus on how mudflow shear behavior depends on relative amounts of water, trapped air, and particles of various sizes. Experiments on Earth will identify how the mixture composition affect flow behavior and will delineate critical parameter ranges to be tested on board the ISS. Microgravity experiments will study the dynamics of hydrophobic particle attachment to air bubbles and the consequences of agglomeration on mixture flow and transport. Results will be used to derive governing equations that can describe the flow behavior of the mixtures, including effects of mixture rheology on the flow. Understanding the processes of mudslide initiation with respect to rainfall intensity and duration will lead to a more accurate predictive capability for the onset and development of mudslides that could mitigate catastrophic damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
