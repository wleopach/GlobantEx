<AbstractNarration>In the study of many fundamental problems in number theory, for example distribution of prime numbers and rational solutions to some polynomial equations, a function on the complex plane, called the L-function, has been associated with the arithmetic object under study. Various properties of the L-functions are believed and have been proved in many special cases to encode deep arithmetic information. This research project is mainly concerned with congruences between special values of L-functions, as well as congruences between automorphic forms, which are multi-variable functions with many symmetries. This project also aims at applying these congruences to study the connection between the special values of L-functions and the sizes of arithmetic cohomology groups in some special cases. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In this project, one aspect is the study of the congruences modulo powers of p between automorphic forms related to theta correspondence. This includes studying the p-adic properties of certain theta lifts by using suitable integral representations of L-functions and L-values for automorphic representations, constructing certain p-adic L-functions and constructing Hida families of theta lifts. The Iwasawa--Greenberg Main Conjecture predicts a connection between the p-adic L-functions and the Selmer groups attached to p-adic deformations of Galois representations. Another aspect of this project is to exploit the results on the congruences to study this conjecture in the special case of the Rankin--Selberg product of a pair of modular forms whose weights are of the same parity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
