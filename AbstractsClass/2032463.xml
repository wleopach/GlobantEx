<AbstractNarration>This project will take initial development steps toward a laser-cut ice-sampling capability in glaciers and ice sheets. The collection of ice samples from the Polar Ice Sheets involves large amounts of time, effort, and expense. However, the most important science data are often retrieved from small sections of an ice core and, while replicate coring can supplement this section of ice core, there is often a need to retrieve additional ice samples based on subsequent scientific findings or borehole logging at a research site. In addition, there are currently no easy methods of extracting ice samples from a borehole drilled by non-coring mechanical drills that are faster, lighter, and less expensive to operate. There are numerous science applications that could potentially benefit from laser-cut ice samples, including sampling ice overlying buried impact craters and bolides, filling critical gaps in chemical records retrieved from damaged ice cores, and obtaining ice samples from sites where coring drills apply stresses that may fracture the ice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will explore a laser cutting technology to rapidly extract high-quality ice samples from a borehole wall. The project will investigate and validate the existing technology of laser ice sampling and will use a fiberoptic cable to deliver light pulses to a borehole instrument rather than attempting to assemble a complete laser system in an instrument deployed in a borehole. This offers a new way of retrieving ice samples from a polar ice sheet without the need to drill a borehole to collect ice-core samples (i.e., the hole could be mechanically drilled). This technology could also be used in existing boreholes or those that are made by augering through ice (i.e., not coring) or made with hot water. If successful, this technique would create the ability to rapidly retrieve ice samples with a small logistical footprint and enable science that might not be supportable otherwise. The proposed technology could eventually provide better access to ice-core samples to study past atmospheric composition for understanding past climate and inform on future potential for ice-sheet change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
