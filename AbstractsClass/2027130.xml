<AbstractNarration>With support from the NSF 2026 Program in the Office of Integrated Activities, Professors Sharp, Ca√±as-Carrell, Harris, Talley, and Weiser at Texas Tech University, a Hispanic-Serving Institution, are hosting a conference to discuss approaches to improve inclusiveness and diversity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The main goal of the conference is to learn more about why some individuals go into and stay in STEM fields and others do not, and to ultimately assist STEM fields in recruiting, training, hiring, and maintaining a more diverse workforce. The conference brings together community members and researchers from many different fields. The activities focus on exploring research approaches to address issues on human development, relationships, and societal messages with the actual life stories of a diverse group of everyday people. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enriching ideas in #33: #WhyNotMe: STEM Diversity Drivers, the conference engages a variety of multidisciplinary academic and practitioner stakeholders in order to create innovative, actionable research agendas to address the persistent problem of effective involvement of students and researchers from underrepresented minority groups in STEM. The #WhyNotMe: STEM Diversity Drivers framework collects and synthesizes a wide range of narratives to further understanding of both supportive and unsupportive mechanisms that affect the involvement in STEM of individuals from different underrepresented groups. The conference focuses on holistic, developmental, relational, structural, and methodological innovations, with the aims to generate actionable research themes. The conference brings together a multidisciplinary team with a variety of substantive expertise and methodological skillsets.  The team will consider the role that factors such as interpersonal relationships, familial support, developmental trajectories, and larger societal messages (e.g., meta-narratives, policies, history) play in supporting and discouraging underrepresented individuals from pursuing STEM.  It will also engage with stakeholders to develop innovative methodological approaches to better capture the complex, fluid landscape of diverse representation in STEM.  The conference participants will develop specific research themes and facilitate methodological innovations to expand the NSF2026 ideas in #WhyNotMe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
