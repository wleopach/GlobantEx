<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to investigate translation of new bioplastic materials as an alternative solution to petroleum-based materials.  The growing environmental concerns regarding the accumulation of microplastics inspires a need for new alternative materials. Petroleum-based products (plastics, fibers such as polyester, nylon, etc.) are notorious for their persistence in the environment because they are not biodegradable when disposed in landfills. From an environmental perspective, it is crucial to develop materials based on cellulose. In addition, cotton is one of the most important cash crops in the United States and most produced cotton fibers go to the textile industry. However, low micronaire (low quality in terms of textile spinning) is a recurring problem and can potentially be applied to other niche markets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is to explore applications of biodegradable materials from cellulose biopolymer derived from low quality cotton fibers. Although considered as waste or discounted for textile applications, these fibers are a premium source of highly crystalline and high-molecular weight cellulose. The technology converts cellulose to a solution and subsequently to commodity products currently produced from petroleum-derived polymers. Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated through producing 3D printed materials, bioplastic films (flexible and stiff), and porous materials.  The ability of this technology to dissolve high molecular weight cellulose (derived from cotton fibers) and its conversion to bioproducts allows preparation of superior performance and versatile cellulose-based bioproducts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
