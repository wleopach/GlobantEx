<AbstractNarration>Computational complexity characterizes what kinds of computational resources,&lt;br/&gt;such as time, effort, space and energy, &lt;br/&gt;are needed to solve challenging mathematical problems derived from real-world&lt;br/&gt;activities, such as designing&lt;br/&gt;aircraft, analyzing DNA evidence, or breaking a secret code.&lt;br/&gt;This project applies recent cutting-edge work from combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;algebra to more clearly determine which problems are intractable (before&lt;br/&gt;too many computational resources are wasted trying to solve them). This is important because,&lt;br/&gt;knowing that a problem is hard to solve computationally can be&lt;br/&gt;used in a different direction, such as creating codes that are harder to&lt;br/&gt;break. Combinatorics is the ancient art of counting complicated mathematical&lt;br/&gt;objects, and was the cradle for the development of early digital computers.&lt;br/&gt;Algebra here refers to the study of certain symmetries which have recently&lt;br/&gt;been discovered to be important in complexity theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, this project approaches Geometric Complexity Theory&lt;br/&gt;from the point of view of algebraic combinatorics to further clarify&lt;br/&gt;feasible approaches to the VP vs. VNP Problem.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, part of the work will be devoted to the computational complexity&lt;br/&gt;of counting certain Young tableaux and computing related constants&lt;br/&gt;and polynomials in Algebraic Combinatorics and Algebraic Complexity,&lt;br/&gt;respectively. These objects and quantities, while introduced in the beginning&lt;br/&gt;of last century, are still not deeply understood. However, they have recently&lt;br/&gt;enjoyed a healthy stream of advances from&lt;br/&gt;various directions. Understanding their computational nature would clarify the&lt;br/&gt;feasibility of some famous problems in Algebraic Combinatorics searching for&lt;br/&gt;natural correspondences (bijections), and pave a new approach to their study,&lt;br/&gt;leading towards better lower bounds in algebraic complexity. These objects and&lt;br/&gt;quantities include understanding the Kronecker coefficients (an 80-year-old&lt;br/&gt;problem), and efficiently computing Kostka and Littlewood-Richardson&lt;br/&gt;coefficients. While no closed-form formulas for these coefficients exist,&lt;br/&gt;their asymptotics can lead to new lower bounds in Geometric Complexity Theory&lt;br/&gt;that are currently out of reach.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, distinguishing Arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;Complexity classes like VP and VNP boils down to distinguishing their&lt;br/&gt;universal polynomials (e.g. determinant vs permanent) under affine&lt;br/&gt;transformations, ultimately translating to inequalities between representation&lt;br/&gt;theoretic multiplicities involving the quantities mentioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
