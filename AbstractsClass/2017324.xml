<AbstractNarration>Floral scent varies among flowers of different species. Even different individuals of the same species often have subtly different combinations of chemicals that combine to make up their scent profiles. In this work we will address two questions. First, how do subtle variations in floral scent affect pollinator attraction and subsequent plant reproductive success? Second, are some scent combinations especially attractive to wild bees, thereby giving some flowers better pollination services and a reproductive edge?  Answering these questions will shed light on the important ecosystem service provided by pollinators. Specifically, results will provide a better understanding of the role of floral scent in pollinator attraction and the consequences of variation in floral scent for plant success. Further, this research will inform management decisions intended to maintain and restore plant and pollinator communities, especially in the context of environmental change. The results of this work will be broadly disseminated to the public, land managers, and the scientific community. The public will be engaged through National Public Lands Day events and National Pollinator Week events focused on healthy pollinators and pollinator habitat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address these questions in a montane wildflower meadow in Montana, USA. Specifically, the research will investigate the consequences of among-species and among-individual variation in floral scent for pollination services and plant reproduction using naturally-growing plants. Second, the researchers will pilot the use of 3-D printed model flowers for use in experiments that manipulate floral scent. Floral scents from naturally-growing flowers will be applied to 3-D printed model flowers and pollinator attraction to these models will be compared to real flowers with the same floral scents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
