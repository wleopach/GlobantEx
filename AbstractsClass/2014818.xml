<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the adoption of solar power by reducing the life-cycle cost of solar energy.  The proposed work is to use a novel approach to improving the efficiency of any solar module with an additive manufacturing process.   The technology tunes sunlight to improve its absorption and maximize its conversion into electric power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed SBIR Phase I project will advance the development of a high-precision additive manufacturing process to create uniform optical layers for solar cells.  A layer of nano-optical coating is created on either a plate-glass or polycarbonate substrate. The proposed coating restricts the wavelength distribution of incident photons to match the bandgap of mono- and polycrystalline silicon solar cells.  The coating enhances coherence by embedding a nano-particle layer creating localized surface plasmon resonance on the crystalline silicon solar cell surface.   Photons are scattered back to the solar cell with a one-dimensional distributed Bragg reflector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary of Results:  SunDensity Inc. developed a novel approach to improving the efficiency of any solar module with innovative additive manufacturing process thus accelerating the cost reduction of solar energy and making it Universally affordable. The company has developed patented (US Patent # 10935707) photonic technology for maximizing the conversion of solar radiation into electric power with an innovative layer by layer manufacturing process for large scale deployment of photonic coating for PV applications. To date, most of the solar industry?s research focus has been on improving Silicon solar cell efficiency while reducing costs (Green, 2015, and 2016, Colin 2014, Ketai, 2011).

Net-net, this conditioning leads to impressive gains in energy output from a mass-market solar module and a significant reduction in the LCOE of solar energy for a wide range of use-cases (SEIA and GTM Research, 2016). SunDensity has built several prototypes that are indicating an increase in energy output by 20%, without the use of any concentrators.     Project Outcomes of NSF SBIR Phase I R&amp;D work:   The design and development and manufacturing of photonic smart coatings for PV applications is significant endevour. The Phase I research objectives estalished the efficacy of PSC coatings and now our intension is to move on with the Phase II of the project. The Phase I R&amp;D activities lead to the following key results:     1.       The magentron sputtering process can be used for the layer-by-layer additive development of the PSC coating using dielectric targets in a vacuum chamber.  2.       The development of the PSC coating was successfully completed by magnetron sputtering and thermal annealing process for the entire stack of the coating layers.  3.       The nano-particles (patterns) in the plasmonic layer stack were successfully created by rapid thermal annelaing.    4.       The temperature and time of annealing using the infrared surface heaters for the plasmonic layers can be calibrated to tune the localised surface plasmonic resonance.  5.       The transmission and reflections curve indicate significant improvement in the transmission of the photon within the target band-stop.  6.       The photons once scattered by the LSPR nano structures are directed by the photonic crsytal in the form of Bragg layers towards the solar cell increasing transimssion.  7.       The tranmission characteristcics of the coated glass panels had demonstrated significant shift and increase in the spectral reponse to AM 1.5 solar radiation.  8.       The performance of a mono crystaline PERC solar cell is significantlly improved from 22.4 % efficiency to 27.3% efficiency which is 20% gain in the base efficiency of 22.4% leading to associated 20% gain in the power output of the solar cell.  9.       The efficacy of the photonic smart coatings in the enhacement of the solar cells is established by third party validation conducted at RIT.  10.    Now we need to conduct scale-up R&amp;D to optimize additive layer-by-layer manufacturing process to enable large scale production of coated glass for PV panel manufacuring companies across the USA.  11.    We are striving to create the fourth generation plasmonic solar PV panel entirely based on US technology and keep the IP in the USA and bring back the USA leadership in Photovoltaic solar power generation.
