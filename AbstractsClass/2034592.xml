<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds to organize the Prairie Analysis Seminar and support its participants at the 2020 and 2021 editions of this annual meeting. The Fall 2020 event will be held on November 13-14, 2020, at the Kansas State University campus in Manhattan, Kansas; the Fall 2021 event will be hosted at the University of Kansas campus in Lawrence, Kansas, on a date to be determined. The Prairie Analysis Seminar is an ongoing joint project by the Mathematics Departments at Kansas State University and The University of Kansas that has been successful and nationally recognized since its inception in 2001. The conference showcases a diverse group of outstanding mathematicians known for their state-of-the-art research in analysis and partial differential equations; it  provides participants in early stages of their careers  with the opportunity to present their work through contributed talks, get advice from experts, expand their professional networks and increase their chances of success in the job market; it promotes the participation from historically underrepresented and underserved groups in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prairie Analysis Seminar features as invited speakers leading scholars well known for their contributions to active areas of research in analysis and partial differential equations and for their mastery to communicate with a broad mathematical audience. As in previous meetings, an invited principal speaker will give two one-hour lectures and will be accompanied by two invited speakers who will each give a one-hour lecture. A main component of the seminar is the time reserved for short talks by participants in early stages of their careers, in particular, advanced Ph.D. students and postdocs. The conference will include a session to discuss open problems suggested by the conference participants and their connections to other areas of related work. The seminar can result in cross-disciplinary activities and establish new directions in this regard since analysis and partial differential equations have a long tradition of applications in other academic fields and industry. The meeting will run for one and a half days from Friday noon to Saturday afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;For more information about the Prairie Analysis Seminar, visit https://www.math.ksu.edu/research/group/analysis/prairie_seminar.html and https://mathematics.ku.edu/prairie-analysis-seminar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
