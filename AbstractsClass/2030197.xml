<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a demonstration of a high-quality, self-disinfecting facemask, which is safe, comfortable, and reusable, and will have an immediate impact during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The filter media used in modern facemasks are either inefficient in filtrating submicron size viruses or are difficult to breathe through and highly uncomfortable. Viruses can be active on a facemask for up to one week. With the possibility of contamination and without a self-disinfection function, facemasks must be disposed of after single use. The proposed highly efficient and self-disinfecting filtration technology will solve these problems. The reusability will also directly address the facemask supply shortage as well as waste disposal issue.  In the long term, this technology may be further applied as window screens for blocking and disinfecting airborne pathogen particles. The self-disinfection function could be adapted for other personnel protective equipment as well as for environment self-disinfection and for food packaging, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an innovative filtration medium for a disruptive facemask technology by effectively capturing submicron particles including viruses via a nanoparticle-functionalized nanofiber mat that has high filtration efficiency and is thin with low air flow resistance.  The technology will also deactivate pathogens in-situ via the   ambient, light-enabled, photocatalytic disinfection function of nanoparticles and the subsequent synergetic effects that include physical and chemical disruption of virus membranes and their RNA/DNA. The functionalized catalysts absorb ambient light, producing reactive oxygen species to disinfect pathogens, while the plasmonic effects enhance the light absorption. The charged nanoparticles are firmly embedded on the electrospun nanofibers, and the resulted surface irregularity, the improved charge density, and the hydrophilic absorption further boost the filtration and trapping efficiency through mechanical and electrostatic capture of aerosol particles. Taken together, all these effects may lead to a highly efficient, breathable, reusable facemask with in-situ self-disinfection functionality to combat highly infectious viruses and a broad spectrum of pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
