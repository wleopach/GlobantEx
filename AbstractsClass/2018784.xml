<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of California Berkeley is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with 1.3 mm and 3.2 mm solid-state probes, a diffusion probe, and micro-imaging capabilities to support Jeffrey Reimer, Hasan Celik, and other colleagues. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, batteries, as well as permitting study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and nearby universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts spectroscopic development of analytical methods to investigate porous and soft materials. The instrumentation is also used for studying supramolecular materials commonly known as MOFs (metal-organic frameworks) capable of absorbing and exchanging gases. In addition, it provides information for developing solid polymer electrolytes for lithium batteries. The NMR spectrometer is also used to sequence dependent materials by optimizing the chemistry of MOF synthesis to establish the relationship between chemical functionality and diffusion rates, and kinetics of uptake and release of substrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
