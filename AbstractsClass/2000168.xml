<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the 2020 - 2022 meetings of the Wabash Seminar and Mini-Conference series, which consists of seminars held at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and an annual weekend mini-conference held in the fall on the Indiana University â€“ Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) campus. The tentative dates of the next annual mini-conference are September 19-20, 2020. The main goal of Wabash Seminar and Mini-Conference series is to bring together the community of researchers working in modern analysis in the Midwest region, along with established researchers from farther afield, in order to stimulate fruitful interactions and encourage collaboration among researchers working in different areas of modern mathematical analysis. Over the years, the seminar and mini-conference have attracted numerous faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students from Indiana University, IUPUI, Purdue University, University of Illinois, University of Cincinnati, Vanderbilt University, and Washington University in St. Louis, among other regional institutions. The Wabash Seminar series offers an excellent opportunity for junior researchers to be exposed to, and informed about, the latest major mathematical developments in the field. Additionally, the series provides an invaluable opportunity to promote research in the Midwest region, helping junior faculty, postdocs, and graduate students in the region to gain exposure within, network with, and disseminate their research to the broader mathematical community. The Wabash Seminar and Mini-Conference series also serves to promote and mentor talented undergraduate students, preparing them for graduate school and research careers in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wabash Seminar and the Mini-Conference series is jointly organized by researchers from four mathematics departments: Indiana University, IUPUI, Purdue University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The research groups from these universities have complementary expertise that spans many of the major directions of research in operator algebras and operator theory: free probability, von Neumann algebras, non-commutative and coarse geometry, C*-algebras and their topological invariants, operator spaces, and non-commutative harmonic analysis as well as connections to quantum information theory, ergodic theory and dynamical systems, and number theory. The regular seminars at Wabash College are scheduled on Saturday afternoons. Two one-hour speakers are invited for each seminar with ample time for discussions among the participants. The Mini-Conference is held over a weekend, from Saturday morning to early afternoon Sunday. Seven plenary speakers are invited to give 50-minute talks, and 30-minute invited and contributed talks are given by postdocs, graduate students, undergraduate students, and visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The website for the Wabash Seminar and Mini-Conference series is: https://www.math.purdue.edu/~tsincla/wabash/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
