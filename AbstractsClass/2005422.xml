<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US students attending SIGMOD 2020, the 2020 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, which will be held in Portland, Oregon, USA (https://sigmod2020.org/) from June 14 to June 19, 2020. The Student Fellowships will help cover the travel costs for 16 US students (out of which 8 will be females and from under-represented groups and at least 4 will be first-time undergraduate students), making it possible for them to attend the conference and discuss and disseminate their work. The conference also provides an opportunity for them to interact with future national and international scientific collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SIGMOD conference, which was established in 1975, has a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction, including research papers, tutorials, panels, industrial papers, technical demonstrations, and undergraduate research papers. The program includes publications relating to all aspects of data management defined broadly, and particularly encourages publications on topics of emerging interest in the research and development communities. The program also includes workshops that showcase dedicated coverage due to their relevance to the current data management research and development, industrial exhibits, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. All these activities provide a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research work with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry. In recent years, more than 800 attendees attended SIGMOD, and we expect the same this year as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
