<AbstractNarration>The world one lives in is geometric in nature where numerous everyday-life issues, as well as &lt;br/&gt;fundamental scientific mysteries, can be expressed in geometric terms. For instance, the study of &lt;br/&gt;physical laws has led to the development of a refined mathematical framework where elaborate &lt;br/&gt;geometric structures are able to depict and model the interactions of elementary particles and the &lt;br/&gt;symmetries underlying quantum physics. Another example comes from networks, which are ubiquitous in modern society. From the &lt;br/&gt;World Wide Web and its powerful search engines to social networks, from telecommunication networks &lt;br/&gt;to economic systems, networks represent a wide range of real world systems. A network can naturally &lt;br/&gt;be seen as a geometric object by considering the number of edges of the shortest path connecting two &lt;br/&gt;nodes in the network as a quantity measuring their proximity. The shortest path distance on a graph is a &lt;br/&gt;fundamental example of an abstract mathematical object called "metric". The notion of a metric space is &lt;br/&gt;an overarching concept that is pivotal in mathematical models of optimization problems in networks, &lt;br/&gt;and in a vast range of application areas, including computer vision, computational biology, machine &lt;br/&gt;learning, statistics, and mathematical psychology, to name a few. This extremely useful abstract concept &lt;br/&gt;generalizes the classical notion of a Euclidean space, where the distance from point A to point B is &lt;br/&gt;computed as the length of a straight line connecting them. In numerous practical problems, &lt;br/&gt;the heart of the matter boils down to understanding whether we can find a&lt;br/&gt;representation of a given metric space, in particular a graph equipped with its shortest path distance, &lt;br/&gt;inside some other geometric object that we understand much better and that carries &lt;br/&gt;additional structure. Our ability to perform such a task in a &lt;br/&gt;quantitatively efficient way has tremendous applications. The project will provide opportunities for &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students to develop a global mindset and superior communication skills, and graduate &lt;br/&gt;students to acquire the algorithmic and programming skills that are crucially needed in the modern &lt;br/&gt;workplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI proposes to implement in several instances the geometric approach, which is a &lt;br/&gt;strategy that consists in understanding and solving problems of seemingly non-geometric nature via the &lt;br/&gt;uncovering of a hidden metric structure that allows the application of a wealth of powerful metric &lt;br/&gt;techniques. Due to its versatility, the geometric approach has permeated virtually all fields of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Creating datasets with billions of entries has become a routine and ubiquitous task. &lt;br/&gt;Optimization, search, and data mining problems on these huge datasets are computationally extremely &lt;br/&gt;hard to solve. Graphs are natural mathematical models for many datasets, and a central computer &lt;br/&gt;science task is the design of efficient and fast approximation algorithms for optimization and search &lt;br/&gt;problems on various graphs. A graph is a combinatorial object of seemingly non-geometric nature. &lt;br/&gt;However, once equipped with a shortest path metric a graph becomes a metric space and the collection &lt;br/&gt;of all metrics supported on the graph carries geometric information that can be used to understand and &lt;br/&gt;study the combinatorial structure of the graph. After its rise in the mid-90's, there are by now numerous &lt;br/&gt;situations where availing to geometric embeddings of graphs, most notably embeddings into tree-&lt;br/&gt;metrics or into the classical Lebesgue sequence spaces, provides elegant, very often optimal, and on &lt;br/&gt;some occasions the only approximation algorithms for computationally intractable problems.  The first &lt;br/&gt;goal of this proposal is to advance significantly our understanding of the general problem of &lt;br/&gt;embeddability of finite metrics. In particular, we will investigate the connection between &lt;br/&gt;lamplighter metrics and Wasserstein metrics from an algorithmic perspective, and the geometry of thin &lt;br/&gt;Laakso structures in relation to the Metric Kadec-Pelczynski Problem. The second goal, which is &lt;br/&gt;motivated by the geometric approach to the Novikov conjecture in topology and to Gromov's positive &lt;br/&gt;scalar curvature conjecture in Riemannian geometry, is to advance significantly our understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;coarse geometry of Banach spaces and the asymptotic behavior of Banach spaces, most notably the &lt;br/&gt;relationship between concentration inequalities on non-locally finite graphs and the Szlenk index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
