<AbstractNarration>This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and education. This project brings together eight undergraduate students with faculty for an eight-week intensive research and learning experience to study the science and technology of environmental conservation. America’s biodiversity hotspots exist within a matrix of urban sprawl, reserves, and working lands. In populated areas, such as California, biodiversity cannot be supported solely through the designation of wildland and conservation areas. There is a need for a broader approach that incorporates humans, their activities, and working lands. This understanding has given rise to reconciliation ecology movements and new science that seek to integrate humanized spaces—working lands such as ranches and farms—with existing systems of wildlands and conservation areas. These approaches expand the habitat for rare plant and animal species as well as sustainably manage and provide ecosystem services to society. The objective of this REU is to train the next generation of land managers and restoration scientists in conservation science and technology to facilitate the transition of working lands to de facto working reserves. We will train a highly diverse group of students in the field on River Ridge Ranch (RRR), a working ranchland near Sequoia National Park, and in the laboratory, in the use of innovative geospatial technologies and systems and the application of the associated STEM biogeographic concepts that inform them. Students will develop their own research questions and carry out original research in teams. They will also receive training in career skills, including professional report writing and oral communication for in-person and virtual visual presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current intersection of population growth, climate change, and resource demand have created a pressing need for re-evaluating land use, especially working landscapes that have high ecological service value. This project will develop a framework for tracking metrics for a triple bottom line of ecosystem services—agricultural production, biodiversity and habitat conservation, and soil health. We will introduce and train students in the conceptual questions framed by this intersection, the choices faced by society and land managers, and the analytical and technological approaches needed to evaluate alternative solutions. We will train teams of students to track changes over time in carbon sequestration, vegetation cover, animal diversity, and other factors. We will use this team-based approach to study how plant communities respond to different disturbance regimes, such as the release of lands from intensive cattle grazing, reimplementation of fire regimes once used by Native Americans, and other forces that cause transitions between different vegetation states (e.g., grasslands to savannas to woodlands) with subsequent changes in ecosystem services. We will introduce a diverse group of students to the use of conservation drones (UAVs) to gather high species specificity data on vegetation. Data will be analyzed using state-of-the-art software systems to provide research teams and land managers with accurate data to inform management decisions that support economic and environmental sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
