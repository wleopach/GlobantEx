<AbstractNarration>Acid mine drainage is globally among the most widespread and expensive forms of pollution.&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate how to use sunlight and natural microbial communities to provide&lt;br/&gt;cost-effective remediation of pollution caused by mining (acid mine drainage), thus improving&lt;br/&gt;access to clean water for humans and the ecosystems that support them. In addition, the&lt;br/&gt;project will contribute more broadly to the development of methods and new understanding of&lt;br/&gt;how microbial populations interact with minerals, organic compounds, and other microbial&lt;br/&gt;populations in the environment. This understanding is crucial in order to harness the enormous&lt;br/&gt;biotechnological potential of microbial systems that can be engineered to provide essential&lt;br/&gt;services to human societies. The proposed work will improve environmental health, increase&lt;br/&gt;diversity in the STEM pipeline, and strengthen international scientific collaborations. Women&lt;br/&gt;and underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students will be recruited to work on this&lt;br/&gt;project. This project will promote collaboration between U.S. and international researchers by&lt;br/&gt;building on long-term relationships between the Spanish Geological Survey (IGME) and Penn&lt;br/&gt;State, such that participants will benefit from international science and engineering training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to identify strategies to stimulate sulfide production in acidic pit lakes.&lt;br/&gt;As a model system, we selected the anoxic deep layer of Cueva de la Mora (CM), a permanently&lt;br/&gt;stratified acidic pit lake in SW Spain that is among the most intensively studied in the world.&lt;br/&gt;Two competing hypotheses emerged from our previous research: 1) Sulfide production is&lt;br/&gt;limited by organic carbon, or 2) Sulfide production is limited by zero-valent sulfur. The project&lt;br/&gt;objectives are to: A) Stimulate autotrophic and heterotrophic sulfide production in laboratory&lt;br/&gt;incubations inoculated with the CM anoxic layer microbial community; B) Resolve the metabolic&lt;br/&gt;potentials and activities of the active populations in the stimulated communities; and C)&lt;br/&gt;Identify interactions between microbial populations cycling C, S, Fe, N, and P under sulfide producing&lt;br/&gt;conditions. Tasks to address these aims include: 1) Conduct a field campaign to&lt;br/&gt;collect large quantities of biomass from the anoxic layer of CM; 2) Conduct laboratory&lt;br/&gt;incubations to evaluate sulfide production under different conditions; 3) Sequence&lt;br/&gt;metagenomes and metatranscriptomes to identify the most abundant and active microbial&lt;br/&gt;populations; and 4) Construct conceptual species-level and community-level metabolic models&lt;br/&gt;to generate new hypotheses about how to increase sulfide production and therefore&lt;br/&gt;bioremediation potential.  This project will contribute to a fundamental and mechanistic understanding of how&lt;br/&gt;microorganisms interact to produce and consume sulfide in acidic environments, which is&lt;br/&gt;crucial to mitigating the toxic effects of acid mine drainage. The results will advance knowledge&lt;br/&gt;of previously undescribed and novel microbial species, including details of their metabolic&lt;br/&gt;potentials, enzymatic machinery, and evolutionary relationships. There are currently only 1-2&lt;br/&gt;sulfide-producing isolates able to grow at pH&lt;4, although the diversity of this group is probably&lt;br/&gt;higher and remains undescribed. Microbial communities in nature are made up of mutually&lt;br/&gt;dependent populations that exchange metabolites, yet scientific studies rarely consider this&lt;br/&gt;complexity explicitly. A significant merit of this proposal is that it focuses on a natural&lt;br/&gt;environment with intermediate complexity, appropriate for expanding and adapting modeling&lt;br/&gt;tools developed for laboratory cultures for natural ecosystems. Documenting microbial&lt;br/&gt;interactions in communities is key to understanding community assembly and to harnessing the&lt;br/&gt;enormous biotechnological potential of engineered microbial systems that can provide&lt;br/&gt;essential services to human societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
