<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest in high quality undergraduate STEM education by introducing a computational, community-oriented component into STEM programs at Xavier University.  Specifically, undergraduate students will develop microcontroller-based systems for collecting airborne particulate data.  They will work with public school teachers and students to deploy the sensors at locations around New Orleans and to analyze the resulting data. Airborne particulates are often the pollutant of greatest concern in minority and other underserved communities. This project will provide undergraduates and the students they mentor with learning experiences that are relevant to the students and their communities.  Research has shown positive effects from student involvement in such real-world, personally relevant STEM projects, including increases in student interest in STEM-related careers after graduation. As a result, the project has the potential to broaden student interest in STEM and increase pursuit of STEM-related majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two specific aims:  1) to develop microcontroller-based systems for collecting environmental data (primarily airborne particulates) and deploy the systems at locations around New Orleans; and (2) to engage Xavier undergraduates in working with public school teachers and students, and government agencies to apply STEM methods to address environmental problems.  The project will help to address insufficient spatiotemporal air quality sampling in and around Xavier University.  The project uses a tiered mentoring system in which the project team members mentor undergraduates, who in turn work with public school teachers and mentor their students.  Utilization-focused evaluation strategies will accommodate student and teacher feedback to ensure that project activities meet local interests and needs. The project will make use of internal and external program tracking and benchmarking metrics to measure student recruitment, retention, and persistence. Analysis and biannual reporting of quantitative and qualitative data collected via surveys, interviews, and student tracking will be used to assess project performance, inform project direction, and evaluate the effects of program elements on the performance, motivation, and aspirations of teachers and students. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
