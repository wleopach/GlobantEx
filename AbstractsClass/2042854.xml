<AbstractNarration>An enterprising science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) research and development (R&amp;D) infrastructure is vital to a healthy and secure nation and its economy. In an effort to highlight R&amp;D, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences is publishing in September 2020 The Perils of Complacency: America at a Tipping Point in Science and Engineering. This award, Promoting Scientific Research and Development in the United States, will facilitate engagement between the scientific community and the public, highlighting recommendations from The Perils of Complacency report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Perils of Complacency builds a case for promoting science as a public good for all Americans. The report addresses a number of particularly challenging issues: recognition of the vital role of scientific research in supporting the health, economy, security and overall wellbeing of Americans; several indicators that the United States may be in danger of losing its position as a global leader in R&amp;D; STEM education outcomes; diversity in the US STEM workforce; and the importance of international cooperation in science. While the report is written for policymakers and other invested stakeholders who are well versed in STEM education and federal research policy, the conference series will provide an opportunity for the American public to learn more about the issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed series of online conferences, Promoting Scientific Research and Development in the United States, will carry that message to the general public and, especially, to young people, whose future depends on how the nation addresses these challenges. The conferences aim to connect the STEM community with students at all levels, state and national policymakers, and the broader public, in conversations about the important role of science, especially fundamental research, in our daily lives. To achieve this goal, three types of webinar series will take place: 1) six to eight lectures with distinguished STEM professionals discussing timely science, technology, and innovation policy issues of serious public concern; 2) two or more STEM graduate student-led events with panel discussions including STEM professionals addressing key science policy issues of specific interest to early-career scientists; and 3) twenty or more school outreach webinars to engage the next generation of STEM workers to demystify science and promote the role of science in society. Through these events, this project will engage a diverse set of audiences on science and technology policy issues and highlight critical issues facing the US R&amp;D enterprise, as well as broader societal challenges where R&amp;D can provide solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
