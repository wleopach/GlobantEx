<AbstractNarration>There is an urgent need to enhance the capacity of government workforces to implement cybersecurity both in their own organizations and in support of the citizens that they serve. Strategic plans outlined by the federal government, including the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014, National Defense Authorization Act of 2018, and the US National Cyber Strategy, call for an increase in the quality and quantity of cybersecurity professionals. This project directly addresses the goal of increasing the number of cybersecurity professionals prepared to join the government workforce by supporting Computer Science students working to complete their Professional Science Master’s (PSM) degree in Cybersecurity at the University of Rhode Island (URI). URI has been designated as both a National Security Agency/Department of Homeland Security Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Cyber Defense Education and a CAE-Research since 2013 and is the only institution in Rhode Island with either designation. URI is well positioned to mount a Scholarships for Service program given their partnership with the Community College of Rhode Island and the number of potential cybersecurity jobs available within the state. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center and Naval War College Cyber Institute are located in Rhode Island, and there are also opportunities within state government. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;URI’s PSM degree in Cybersecurity is designed with the specific goal of preparing students for the cybersecurity workforce through training in both advanced technical skills and professional skills.. This project provides scholarships for a total of 20 students to complete their PSM either through URI’s  five year program with support while both undergraduate and graduate students, or as graduate-only students. The URI scholarship program plans a targeted recruitment approach to promote the participation of underrepresented groups and therefore increase diversity in the cybersecurity workforce. The plan includes working with the National Center for Women in Technology as well as URI’s chapters of the Society for Women in Computing and Society for Black Engineers. The experience for URI cybersecurity scholars includes a combination of undergraduate coursework and research, graduate coursework, a program of activities focused on cybersecurity career readiness, and a cybersecurity internship. Coursework also addresses professional skills including training in project planning, communication, and organizational behavior. Scholars also have the option to obtain professional certifications in cybersecurity and to attend relevant events and professional meetings. The project team plans to disseminate lessons learned and cyber career readiness materials within the cybersecurity community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the CyberCorps® Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
