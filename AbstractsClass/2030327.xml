<AbstractNarration>The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to protect the public during the COVID-19 pandemic through contact tracing.  This project will develop wearable technology to provide proximity alerts when workers are in close contact, creating awareness around social distancing. It will also record every contact between workers to provide contact tracing should a worker test positive for COVID-19. These tools protect front-line workers from the spread of the virus, along with their families and communities. The technology will extend existing wearable technology to reduce overexertion injuries in the workplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will estimate distance between workers through a machine learning algorithm combining signal strength from Bluetooth technology with motion sensor data from accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure worker activity prior and at the end of each contact event. The project will develop distance detection algorithms and a set of performance requirements to optimize design of a rapid, accurate solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

These led to outcomes that have been incorporated into our current product in the field, and are currently in use by hundreds of workers.  As next steps for the technology, there are two directions the technology will take going forward: i) continued innovation to protect workers from COVID-19 infection and ii) exploration of additional features to add to the wearable device to protect workers from other injuries and illnesses.
