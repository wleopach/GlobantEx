<AbstractNarration>Freshwater fisheries provide food, income, and recreation to millions of people.  Conventional management of these systems typically relies on the implementation of management rules based on assessments of fish populations.  Little consideration is given to the capacity of institutions to enforce management rules or the social factors that affect the motivations of fishers to comply with them.  Consequently, freshwater fisheries are often poorly managed and overfished.  Working with a community-based management system for freshwater fish, this project will integrate fish ecology, population dynamics, institutional analysis, and social psychology to understand the social and ecological factors affecting the sustainability of freshwater fisheries. Research results will inform policy on the integrated dynamics of community-based management of fish resources. In addition to education of graduate students and peer-reviewed publication of the research, we will build on our case study to develop an open-access, web-based training program on fisheries as coupled natural and human systems aimed at senior-level undergraduate students. This program will use written, video, and project-based materials to contribute to fill the growing demand in higher education for development and sharing of teaching materials in coupled human and natural systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study interactions between floodplain ecosystems, movement of freshwater fish, and their use of lakes on the ecological side, and culture, community, institutions, and fisher rule compliance on the social side. The team will use an integrated modeling approach that incorporates social and ecological components at three scales of analysis to produce novel and general insights on the integrated dynamics of fisheries. To do this, they will collect extensive socio-ecological data and use knowledge co-production with fishers and managers to address four overarching research questions: how habitat and connectivity affect fish movement among lakes to identify drivers of fish lake use, and thereby explain their abundance across the ecosystem; how fishers’ perceptions of fish abundance, and income they derive from fishing, affect their compliance with institutional rules, given community culture, leadership, and institutional arrangements; how rule compliance is affected by regional factors, markets, and government rules; and finally, because the emergent property of sustainability arises from the interplay of social and ecological factors, how ecosystem habitat and connectivity and fishers’ rule compliance affect the dynamics of fish populations. The approach will push knowledge frontiers by pioneering contributions to the theory, methods, and applications of coupled natural and human systems research to freshwater fisheries and other common pool resources such as marine fisheries or wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
