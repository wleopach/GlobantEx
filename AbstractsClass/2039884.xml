<AbstractNarration>This project will contribute data and an analytical synthesis to the Arctic Councilâ€™s (AC) Pan-Arctic Report on Gender and Diversity in the Arctic. Advancing gender equality through empowerment is a key component of sustainable global development. Empowerment is the capacity of individuals and groups to exercise control over their social, economic, and political circumstances. Empowerment enables people to achieve objectives and maximize the quality of their lives and those of their families and communities. This project will collect, analyze, and synthesize data on the current state and emerging trends in gender equality and empowerment across the Arctic. The full Arctic Council report will include policy-relevant conclusions and be broadly disseminated among Arctic stakeholders, policy makers, and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will employ an inclusive, collaborative approach to collect and analyze datasets, documents, and case studies to understand to what extent political, economic, and civic empowerment is distributed by gender. Activities include the integration of data from diverse sources, including existing demographic, income, and employment statistics, legal and government documents, and Indigenous scholars and stakeholders. Broader impacts of the work include recommendations for the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls, raising public awareness of gender issues in the Arctic, and the development of a publicly available data compendium on gender empowerment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
