<AbstractNarration>Salish Kootenai College (SKC), in collaboration with the Blackfeet Native Science Field Center at Blackfeet Community College (BCC NSFC) and Hopa Mountain, a Bozeman, Montana based nonprofit organization are developing a Native Science Fellows effort. The project supports Native American undergraduate studentsâ€™ diverse pathways to geosciences careers by providing fellowships with science organizations, nonprofits and other tribal colleges. The project will also focus on active cohort groups to increase engagement in higher education and geosciences careers. Specific objectives of the initiative are to match promising tribal college and university students annually with hands-on field work and professional research experiences to build skills and pathways to academic and professional careers in the geosciences. These students will also be mentored by geosciences professionals and a supportive cohort network throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By creating three cohort groups of Fellows linked to two tribal colleges and universities, this initiative will be able to compare and contrast the pathways of these Fellows at each site to determine the most effective strategies to (1) increase the number of Indigenous students who are engaged in community-based geosciences research, field experiences and careers; (2) develop work and training programs for Indigenous tribal college and university students interested in the geosciences; (3) build a network of community-based science professionals who are committed to the success of Native American and Latino students and provide ongoing support for personal, academic and professional success; and (4) prepare these students to transfer to undergraduate or graduate school. These goals align with the GEO Education and Diversity Strategic Framework goals of developing a diverse, competitive, and engaged geosciences workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by The Directorate for Geosciences GEOPAths Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
