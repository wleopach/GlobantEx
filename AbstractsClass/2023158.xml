<AbstractNarration>Geoscience is one of the least diverse disciplines in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  This program will apply scientifically ratified best practices to Provide Educational Access to Research &amp; Learning in geocienceS (PEARLS) for non-traditional geoscience majors, women, under-served, and underrepresented minorities (URM). The work will increase the awareness and access to the geosciences and will develop a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. The project will engage students in the geosciences through extracurricular experiences and training. The project provides a geoscience learning ecosystem with integrated experiences at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) to help undergraduate upperclassmen from non-traditional geoscience majors and masterâ€™s degree-seeking students transition into geosciences and engage in geoscience studies. The experiences will help students matriculate more successfully in geoscience graduate programs and the geoscience workplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create catalytic experiences for students to engage in interdisciplinary geoscience work. The learning design is composed of three critical objectives. The PIs will i) create a mentorship program that includes a life-long learning enrichment program culminating in nationally recognized certification and/or apprenticeship with academics, as well as with and the state and local governments. ii) design and test bridge programs to help post-undergraduate students from non-geoscience fields transition into geoscience graduate programs and iii) foster career-aligned collaborations between academia and the local private sector or state/local government sector that facilitate transitions between undergraduate/graduate programs and the geoscience workforce. The proposed learning ecosystem model offers three distinct pathways to enhance technical expertise and knowledge of non-traditional geoscience majors in virtual and in-person platforms. The technical knowledge and promotion of growth is supported by a vertically tiered mentor network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
