<AbstractNarration>More than 90% of lakes on Earth are covered with ice in the winter. When a lake is covered with ice, this affects many ecosystem processes. The timing of when ice forms and how long it lasts are both important, but so are the thickness and clarity of the ice. Changing climate conditions have affected the duration of ice cover as well as the quality of ice, as warm winter temperatures can cause temporary thawing. There are three different ways to understand lake ice and its impacts, each with strengths and weaknesses. Observations from the shore of the lake are accurate but do not capture many aspects of lake ice timing, extent, and quality. Remote sensing techniques provide new opportunities to expand the scale and scope of research on ice-covered lakes. Lake models can estimate ice parameters that are difficult to measure such as ice thickness. In order to fully understand global lake ice dynamics and how they are changing, stronger connections between limnologists, remote sensing scientists, and modelers are needed. This project will support a workshop to study the dynamics of lake ice formation and the consequences for ecosystem functioning of temperate lakes. Participants in the workshop will join the annual Frozen Assets Festival in Madison, Wisconsin and participate in public events. Researchers studying lake ice from around the world will describe the ecological role and cultural value of lake ice and demonstrate how remote sensing is used to understand lake ice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current lake ice database only contains 631 lakes with land-based observations, but there are millions of lakes that freeze every year. The workshop will achieve four main goals: 1) Identify critical questions about lake ice that require cross-disciplinary approaches, 2) Improve cross-disciplinary understanding of how data are acquired and used, 3) Reach consensus on core aspects of a cross-disciplinary lake ice database, and 4) Develop a diverse community of researchers to foster collaborative projects. The objectives will be achieved through a series of interactive sessions and breakout groups during the workshop. A structure for a global lake ice database will also be developed. There are specific activities before, during and after the workshop to initiate and support community-building among scientists from different fields. Ultimately, the workshop will produce guidance and resources for a broad range of researchers working with ice-covered lakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
