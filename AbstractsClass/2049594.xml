<AbstractNarration>In this project the adaptation of two crucial institutions in the lives of young people -- family and school – in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated measures is investigated. Research involves documentation of interactions between schools and families amid the crisis and analysis of the processes through which schools facilitate the construction of social capital among families even as they have closed school buildings and moved instruction online.  Subsequently, links are traced between these family/school interactions and students’ learning experiences.  Results will inform research and decisions aimed at reducing disparities and fostering resilience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data consist primarily of three waves of survey of teachers, parents, and principals for a county school district in a county with considerable demographic and socioeconomic variation.  These data are combined with administrative data for the school district as well as data on parent-teacher organizations and data from a statewide teacher survey of working conditions.  These data are used to address several research questions, including: 1) how school and family collaboration varies with demographic and socioeconomic status; 2) to what extent this variation is attributable to differences in practices used during the remote learning period across and within schools; 3) to what extent school and family collaboration facilitates access to critical resources for students and their families; 4) to what extent school and family collaboration mitigates learning losses associated with the pandemic and related measures and how that varies by social group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
