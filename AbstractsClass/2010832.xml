<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research seeks to understand heat tolerance in corals through an integrative study on the combined effects of coral physiology and its microbial partners. Reef-building corals make up the 3D habitat structure of global coral reefs that are ecologically, economically, and culturally significant ecosystems. Notably, corals live in symbiosis with bacteria that contribute greatly to coral survival, and these partners can often shift in response to changes in the environment. Rapidly increasing ocean temperatures due to climate change severely threaten coral survival, but all corals are not equally vulnerable to climate change. Corals already living in extreme environments may offer insight into how corals that are tolerant to ocean warming might survive into the future when the global climate will become more extreme. The extent to which coral-associated bacteria may improve coral survival under extreme ocean warming is poorly understood. This research will help to reveal how coral-associated bacteria may help corals that are less tolerant to ocean warming to survive climate change. Additionally, the project will provide data that will assist scientists in planning interventions to protect coral reefs that are economically and culturally important to coastal communities. The Fellow, an under-represented Latina immigrant, will be exposed to resources not otherwise available outside of this project. The training plan for the Fellow includes co-mentorship from coral experts in the US and Europe, extending the Fellow’s scientific network and resources across two hemispheres. To broaden participation of others, the Fellow will serve as a role model and conduct mentoring and outreach activities for members of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first goal of the project is to compare the composition of coral-associated bacteria in favorable and extreme environments by analyzing samples from coral species present in both inland bay and fringing reefs of Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean. The second goal is to perform a reciprocal transplant experiment between favorable and extreme reefs in the Florida Keys Reef Tract, USA to determine how the bacterial community contributes to coral acclimatization capacity. Because studying coral adaptive capacity takes major, long-term commitments in the field, the third goal is to utilize a laboratory coral model, the Exaiptasia anemone, to predict bacterial community responses to thermal stress at different life stages. Sample processing includes DNA extraction, polymerase chain reactions (PCR), library preparation, high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and novel bioinformatics pipelines. In effort to broaden the participation of groups under-represented in biology, the Fellow will draw on experiencing a similar background, to integrate mentorship, inquiry-based learning, and outreach with the goals of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
