<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program supports RAPID projects when there is a severe urgency with regard to availability of, or access to, data, facilities or specialized equipment, including quick-response research on natural or anthropogenic disasters and similar unanticipated events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  The project at North Carolina A&amp;T State University seeks to develop theories that explain and predict decision making processes in students studying in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields during and after pandemics. These theories will inform and transform the adaptation and resiliency of Institutions of Higher Education during future global disasters. Improved institutional resiliency will minimize disruptions to STEM student functioning and performance, reduce attrition, and strengthen progression into the STEM workforce. Undergraduate students are involved as researchers in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substantive theories will be constructed to explain and predict cognitive improvisation decision making processes in undergraduate STEM students during pandemics. A constructivist grounded theory approach with critical incident and symbolic interactionist emphasis will allow the use of iterative and inductive processes of data collection with simultaneous analysis and interpretation. Methodological triangulation will involve primary data obtained through interviews, surveys, and academic transcripts from STEM students, faculty, and administrators in six institutions. The comparative and iterative synthesis of emergent codes will provide insights into interactions existing among student characteristics, lived experiences, cognitive improvisation decisions, and STEM performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Substantive theories will inform and transform the adaptation and resiliency of institutions of higher education during future global disasters. Improved institutional resiliency will minimize disruptions to STEM performance, reduce STEM attrition, and strengthen student progression into the STEM workforce. Theories will also advance research and practice related to cognitive decision-making processes in other contexts, particularly other high risk disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award is made by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program in the Division of Human Resource Development, Directorate of Education and Human Resources, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
