<AbstractNarration>The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the development of a new method to conduct infrared spectroscopy, an important tool in the life sciences, materials development and pharmaceutical industries. Chemical producers will spend an estimated $140 million on analytical instrumentation in 2020.  The instrument concept is based on human vision, which can deduce roughly 10 million colors from the signals extracted from just three types of light-sensitive cones that have overlapping sensitivity to measure color combinations. The proposed solution uses the same architecture, replacing multiple instruments with a single device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will advance the translation of an algorithmic spectroscopy tool. Utilizing newly available thermal emitter technology with tunable center emission frequency across the infrared (2-10 microns wavelength), the program will demonstrate that spectroscopic information can be recovered algorithmically from a series of non-dispersive absorption measurements. The technology uses the human vision system as a model and pairs multiple emitters with overlapping emission spectra with low-cost, non-dispersive infrared detectors, such as thermopiles. The proposed solution will develop an algorithmic spectroscopy solution at a frequency range of 3800-2100 cm-1 by demonstrating sensitivity to the characteristic CO2 absorption bands and algorithmically reconstructing the CO2 spectrum. Successful completion of the proposed effort will establish the benchmarks for a new infrared spectroscopy technology that operates without costly dispersive elements or moving parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
