<AbstractNarration>Visualization of biomacromolecules at atomic resolutions provides important information&lt;br/&gt;for the in-depth understanding of the fundamental biological processes and the rules of life.&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance have been the only two&lt;br/&gt;available structural tools that can experimentally determine three-dimensional (3D) structures of&lt;br/&gt;biomacromolecules at atomic levels. Recent advances in the instrumentation and methodology of&lt;br/&gt;the advanced microscopy technique called single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is&lt;br/&gt;a game-changer for molecular visualization. The cryo-EM technique has become the preferred&lt;br/&gt;technique for determining the 3D structure of large macromolecular complex or membrane&lt;br/&gt;proteins that have been dauntingly challenging to either of the two conventional structural&lt;br/&gt;techniques. This fellowship will support the PI to develop the cryo-EM expertise at the Cryo-EM&lt;br/&gt;Center of the California Institute of Technology and apply the cryo-EM technique to the structural&lt;br/&gt;characterization of biomolecules at the atomic level. Adding cryo-EM to the PI’s structural toolbox&lt;br/&gt;will not only stimulate new research directions in the PI’s research group at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Nebraska-Lincoln, but also benefit many research groups across the state of Nebraska, which is&lt;br/&gt;the only state that hosts a Big10 university but without expertise or instrumentation for cryo-EM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of this fellowship, the PI and her group member will receive&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive training on structural characterization of metalloproteins and assemblies by cryo-&lt;br/&gt;EM, from grid preparation, image collection to 3D map construction and model development. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, this project will focus on the structural investigation of two families of interconnected&lt;br/&gt;metalloproteins involved in bacterial redox stress response and transition metal homeostasis,&lt;br/&gt;respectively. The expertise in cryo-EM acquired from this training will propel the PI’s group to&lt;br/&gt;successfully achieve research goals in both the short and long term. The structural information&lt;br/&gt;resulted from the proposal will fill critical gaps in fundamental structural principles that govern&lt;br/&gt;the metalloproteins in the bacterial response to biotic and abiotic redox stresses and antibiotic&lt;br/&gt;resistance. In the long run, adding the cryo-EM expertise to the PI’s interdisciplinary skillset will&lt;br/&gt;better position the PI to play a leading role in structure-mechanism investigations of&lt;br/&gt;metalloproteins in redox biology. From an educational aspect, this proposal will provide direct&lt;br/&gt;training opportunities to graduate students and postdocs using the cryo-EM technique. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;the acquired knowledge of the application of cryo-EM will be integrated into the teaching and&lt;br/&gt;training activities conducted by the PI at UNL, aligning with the educational goal in the PI’s NSF&lt;br/&gt;CAREER award. Furthermore, by working with the colleagues at the University of Nebraska&lt;br/&gt;system, the PI’s cryo-EM expertise will enable new research explorations and catalyze new&lt;br/&gt;collaboration across the campus and promote innovation research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
