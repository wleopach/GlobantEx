<AbstractNarration>With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this conference aims to develop and test a series of measures to assess how HSIs achieve success in their efforts to serve their diverse students and improve STEM learning. While many indicators assess individual student retention and graduation, there is less consensus on how to measure the systemic changes needed to improve student learning and graduation rates. By bringing together practitioners from HSIs and scholars to co-develop measures of institutional change at HSIs, we expect to develop and test a series of measures to support work at a diverse set of HSIs, including community colleges, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions, and research-intensive universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of the project are to operationalize a framework for servingness developed to conceptualize institutional changes necessary to improve educational attainment for the diverse student population at HSIs. The conference will specifically develop and test measures of change for: research development and success; faculty engagement with STEM curricular change and students; faculty success measures; STEM undergraduate student success measures; community engagement; and diverse cultural engagement and recognition. We expect that the identification and use of change measures will assist universities in improving the likelihood of student STEM degree attainment at HSIs. The work will be disseminated broadly through conference participation, publications, and the use of the measures at a diverse group of HSIs around the U.S. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
