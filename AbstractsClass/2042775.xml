<AbstractNarration>As the science community works together to solve large-scale global challenges, the commitment and accord of funding agencies is invaluable in advancing the work necessary to solve these challenges. The planning meetings on Science Diplomacy to Promote and Strengthen Basic Research and International Cooperation will explore options and best practices for U.S. and other funding agencies to consider with regard to global norms for basic research collaboration. The meeting will also investigate the role of U.S. and other funding agencies in science diplomacy and how best to leverage and strengthen networks. As global problems affect the U.S population and others around the world, promoting the advancement of basic science aims to benefit the public within the context of working toward global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Global Research Council (GRC) represents an important constituency of heads of science and engineering funding agencies from around the world that are dedicated to promoting high-quality collaboration among funding agencies worldwide. The GRC plays a unique role in the scientific research enterprise, as scientists rely on funding agencies to conduct their work. The planning meetings on will identify different mechanisms and approaches for investigating the links between international basic research cooperation in the context of science diplomacy, such as: What are the current structures currently available to look at international basic research cooperation in a frame of science diplomacy?; What are the areas within basic research that might be worth exploring in greater depth to better connect research funders and science diplomacy practitioners?; What opportunities are there for the GRC and funder community to find new ways to work together on those areas and projects?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
