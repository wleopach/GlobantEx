<AbstractNarration>To support participation in the Mathematical Congress of the Americas (MCA), to be held July 19 – 24, 2021 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the American Mathematical Society (AMS) will administer a travel-grant program for mathematicians based in the United States (US)—those who are students or faculty in US institutions or employees of US organizations or companies. The Society will strive to draw a robust and diverse applicant pool by utilizing its infrastructure of communications and its connectivity in the mathematical community, and it will work to ensure that mathematicians from groups historically underrepresented in STEM areas receive particular attention. In the selection process, AMS expects to give priority to early-career applicants. MCA is a quadrennial gathering, initiated in 2013, with the goal "to internationally highlight the excellence of mathematical achievements in the Americas and foster collaborations among researchers, students, institutions, and mathematical societies in the Americas." The conference is administered by the Mathematical Council of the Americas, a network of over twenty societies, institutes, and agencies throughout North America, South America, Central America, and the Caribbean nations. This third Congress will draw top-tier mathematicians from around the Western Hemisphere and the rest of the world. It will provide an excellent opportunity for exchange of ideas in a broad array of mathematical areas and for the US to be well represented in the international arena. The US sustains its highly-regarded research endeavor, in part, by fostering the participation of its citizens in international conferences. MCA presents an excellent opportunity for such participation, both by established researchers as well as those who will become the research leaders of the future. Those traveling to Buenos Aires will be able to share in person the results of their research and garner new ideas from their counterparts from across the Americas, thereby enriching the hemispheric and worldwide endeavor of mathematical discovery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizers of MCA 2021 anticipate approximately one thousand attendees from around the Western Hemisphere and the rest of the world. The six plenary speakers are Ian Agol (University of California, Berkeley, USA), Julia Chuzhoy (Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, USA), Carlos Kenig (University of Chicago, USA), Allan Sly (Princeton University, USA), Claire Voisin (Collège de France, France), and Miguel Walsh (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina). Twenty-two Invited Speakers represent such topical areas as algebraic geometry, analysis, probability, ergodic theory, differential geometry, partial differential equations, relativity and gravitation, numerical analysis, graph theory and combinatorics, applied computational analysis, complex analytic geometry, dynamical systems, Riemann manifolds, algebraic topology, geometry, stochastic calculus, fractal geometry, number theory, model theory, statistical mechanics, and neuroscience. The conference will include a wide array of special session topics, and it is anticipated that the schedule will include multiple panel and poster sessions as well as social and cultural events. The MCA is also the occasion for awarding the MCA Prize, the Americas Prize, and the Solomon Lefschetz Medals. The Congress presents a splendid opportunity for early-career mathematicians to share their knowledge, garner new ideas, and interact with counterparts and luminaries on the international stage. Current information about MCA 2021 is at www.mca2021.org, and the AMS travel grant program is detailed at https://www.ams.org/programs/travel-grants/mca.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
