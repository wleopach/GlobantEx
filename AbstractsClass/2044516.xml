<AbstractNarration>Today's wireless networks are being re-shaped by ubiquitous wireless connectivity and emerging network architectures. To meet the increasingly growing demand from the users for more efficient, reliable, and secure wireless network services, the project aims at exploring the new dimension of creating data-driven approaches towards improving the wireless network performance and security. One key difference between the proposed data-driven approaches and traditional network designs is that the online data due to network behaviors and activities will be collected, processed, and used in systematic ways towards improving wireless network efficiency, reliability, and security. The research will create, design, and optimize efficient methodologies to categorize, process, classify, use, and validate wireless network data for network performance and security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on efficiently harnessing and leveraging the online data observed in wireless networking to improve network efficiency and security. Specifically, the research team in this project aims at i) creating data-driven approaches based on network link data to improve the throughput performance of the wireless links, ii) effectively managing and mitigating wireless collisions and interference by collecting and processing network control and data packets, iii) understanding how new security threats and attack strategies can emerge and behave based on  observed network data in the wireless channel as well as designing effective countermeasure against such threats and attacks, iv) conducting extensive simulations and experimental evaluations to validate the data-driven approaches towards wireless network efficiency, reliability and security. In addition, appropriate elements in the research from the project will be integrated into educational materials. The research results will also be widely disseminated to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
