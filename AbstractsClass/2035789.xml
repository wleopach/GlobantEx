<AbstractNarration>As a fluid moves around a cylindrical or similarly shaped structure, the flow organizes into coherent vortices, which shed from alternate sides of the body producing a vibrational force. This vortex-induced-vibration is an undesirable consequence with far-reaching effects in engineering design, from long cylindrical mooring or transmission lines to structural supports of bridges, as well as many other applications susceptible to fluid flow. This project investigates potential methods to mitigate the unsteady vortex pattern and associated vibrational force by adding undulations along the cylinder. The specific geometry is inspired by the whiskers of seals which have shown that an alternating undulation pattern along the surface significantly reduces the vortex-induced-vibration under certain flow conditions. Of particular interest is how the wake behind the undulated structures can be modified and how it, in turn, would impact a system of closely packed structures. This has a variety of potential applications from hydrodynamic sensor arrays, the design of wind turbine farms, or the study of weather patterns over non-uniform forest canopies and mountainous terrain.  The educational components will include multiple undergraduate research projects and K-12 outreach programming integrated into existing dissemination mechanisms at University of Wisconsin-Madison and Portland State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores the fundamental fluid mechanisms of flow over undulated cylinders and arrays of undulated cylinders inspired by the unique topography of seal whiskers. Causal links between the geometric features of the undulations, the resulting flow features, and the force and frequency response of the cylinder will be quantitatively identified by critical points and other key markers within the wake in terms of momentum and energy transfer. Building upon the single-cylinder data, a framework for wake-wake and wake-structure interactions will be developed and tested for small and large array configurations. Both simulations and wind tunnel experiments will be utilized in a complementary and collaborative research plan that spans a large range of flow conditions and configurations. This will be accomplished through particle-image-velocimetry for detailed wake measurements as well as direct numerical simulation and large-eddy simulations for time-resolved forces and quantification of mechanisms in the near-wake region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
