<AbstractNarration>The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program (HSI Program) supports RAPID projects when there is severe urgency with regard to availability of, or access to, data, facilities or specialized equipment, including quick-response research on natural or anthropogenic disasters and similar unanticipated events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This project aims to explore challenges faced by students and instructors at HSIs after moving to online formats during COVID-19. Longitudinal surveys and interviews seek to reveal how students and instructors cope with courses moving online, and how course experiences are impacted by this move.  The study also aims to identify the resources and supports that are most helpful to students and instructors and to catalog resources that are still needed. The research will include examination of how findings differ for students and instructors from underrepresented and underserved communities (i.e., Latinx and Native American). Data collected will contribute knowledge regarding attitudes and coping processes during crises. Results seek to inform best practices for HSIs during recovery from this pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low perceived control over outcomes and fear of performing worse than peers affect coping skills and attitudes among undergraduates. College and minority stress, likely augmented by this pandemic, exacerbate depression, in turn reducing persistence. Moreover, resources necessary for success (e.g., internet) are not always accessible to underserved communities. One-hour online surveys and 1.5-hour semi-structured interviews will be conducted across Arizona HSIs in May-June, August-September, and October-November 2020. Surveys will include rating scales (e.g., sense of belonging). Interviews, oversampling from underrepresented populations, will include think aloud protocols and questions about resources and course experiences. This mixed methods project will contribute knowledge of attitudinal and emotional processes and reactions to institutional supports. Identified institutional and instructional practices will inform recovery from this pandemic. Preliminary results will be shared with HSIs and the broader community via the NSF HSI Hub, brief reports, webinars, and a project website. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award is made by the HSI Program in the Division of Human Resource Development, Directorate of Education and Human Resources, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
