<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The Akron-REU site in Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering provides a holistic research experience for undergraduates. The REU site activities includes dissemination of the foundational aspects of polymer science and engineering, followed by an immersive experience in cutting-edge research in the field. Students participating in the Akron-REU program come from universities across the nation, representing the diversity of the student talent pool. The core mission of the program is to broaden research participation, with particular emphasis on students from primarily undergraduate institutions and historically underrepresented populations including women, minorities and students with disabilities. The REU site provides a research experience that is tailored towards achieving increasing independence of the undergraduate researcher through the course of the 9-week program. Students participate in leading-edge research in polymer chemistry, polymer physics, polymer processing and macromolecular bioscience. These projects span the spectrum from sustainable materials, energy materials, high-performance materials and biomaterials. The REU students partake in activities such as visits to local industries and government laboratories to broaden their perspectives on research outside of the academic environment. The REU site engages with experts to provide their insight to students through panel discussions on topics ranging from research to career avenues and soft-skills development. The diverse program portfolio of the Akron-REU site prepares undergraduate participants for graduate school or for entering the workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Undergraduate researchers in the Akron-REU site engage in research designed to address current and future challenges in polymer science and polymer engineering. By participation in the collaborative environment of more than twenty research laboratories working on all aspects of the field, students obtain an advanced knowledge of the field. REU students work on topics of polymer chemistry, polymer physics, polymer processing and macromolecular biosciences. Topics in these fields range from computational advances for materials development, synthesis and characterization of sustainable polymers and stimuli responsive materials, interfacial characterization of polymeric materials, advanced fabrication methods and materials for 3D printing, mimicking and incorporating designs from nature, improved materials and processes for coatings and adhesives and bioinspired materials for tissue engineering. The REU participants present their research findings to their peers and faculty members through the course of the program. At the end of the program the participants present their research in an undergraduate symposium jointly hosted by other REU programs in northeast Ohio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
