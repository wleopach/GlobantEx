<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The goal of this research project is to actively capture and decontaminate surfaces from the COVID-19 virus. This project studies atomically tailored ceramic surface coatings by examining ionic exchange, dielectric properties, and physical texturing. Surface activated ceramic particles are interesting due to their biocompatible nature and effective antigerm activity. The size, shape, and morphology of the particles also impact antigerm responses. The possible mechanisms for antiviral activity include both atomic-scale physical and chemical interactions with the virus' body including spike, coating, and capsid. Chemical interactions include photo-activation of the particles, the formation of reactive oxygen species, and metal ion release, while physical interactions include membrane disruption and mechanical damage to the virus. This research applies advanced indirect and direct techniques to study the interaction of the ceramic with the virus at multiple length scales. This project is especially timely for the protection of multiple surfaces, since the US will reopen in the coming months. The project involves teamwork among scientists, engineers, educators, and industry experts. Training the next generation of the workforce with the ability to grasp the philosophy of convergence is another key outcome of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Coronavirus particles have spike proteins (S-proteins) that are responsible for the attachment to the host cells. Specifically, in humans, the SARS and SARS-CoV-2 species have been shown to interact with the host cell receptor protein ACE2 (a zinc metalloprotein). This virus-cell binding is controlled by the polar interaction between the protein molecules. This research project focuses on using polar ceramic-based structures for the capture and deactivation of the coronavirus. Ionic ceramic solids show intrinsic polarity due to the unique arrangement of atoms across different crystalline facets. For example, the alternate basal planes along [0001] direction contain two separate atoms, which lead to intrinsic polarity. The central hypothesis of this research is that ionic surface defects and the polarity on the surface of ceramic particles benefit the effective capture of coronavirus particles and their subsequent deactivation through ionic modulation. Characterization techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are being used for the analysis of physical defects. The effect of ionicity on capture and deactivation is being tested via indirect and direct methods. The indirect testing protocol includes inoculation of the surfaces with virus particles and then measuring the number of infectious virus particles. Successful findings are being applied to hard and porous surfaces for aerospace, automotive, retail, and other critical industry sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplement allocated to MPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
