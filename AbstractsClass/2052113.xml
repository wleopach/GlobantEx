<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/ commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is the creation of a new set of tools for bioscience applications. The innovation has shown promise in benchtop tests to fill a capability gap in manufacturing, and the project will build upon this promise to create 3-dimensional nanoscale fluid pathways. The first target application is to enable widespread use of nanometer-sized particles (30-150 nm) to carry cell signaling information throughout the body. Particles designed to signal a particular cellular response are a major component of drug therapeutics as their size allows them to access parts of the body otherwise impossible to reach, such as the blood-brain barrier in the event of a stroke and tumor penetration for cancer patients. Problematic for these research endeavors is the differentiating these particles from others due to similarity in size (100-300 nm). The innovation could enable these nanoscale entities to traverse nanoscale pathways, resulting in size and physics-based exclusion from other particles. Success in this project aids in promoting the advancement of detection and treatment for global health issues, adding to the general welfare of society, as well as creating a new sector in U.S. bioeconomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase I assesses the feasibility of a potentially disruptive new manufacturing process to create a solid form structure with 3-dimensional pathways, such as helices and sine waves, of circular cross section interior channels for use in micro/nano-fluidics products. The innovation uses the physics of fluid flow to dynamically mold a fluid against a smart fluid, during which process the diameter of the channel being formed can be changed by adjusting the process variables in real-time. The work progresses the knowledge associated with advancing manufacturing capabilities and enables a wide variety of fields based on the products made using the method. For the former, the technology provides a new way to rapidly create fluidic pathways for nano to micro structures, enhancing the understanding of fluidic behaviors, polymerization, smart fluid applications, and creates a new field of study for the dynamic behavior of fluid/fluid molding. The technical goals of the Phase I work use a combination of fluidic modeling and the set-up and execution of a series of experimental tests to demonstrate active control of the channel diameter for 50-500 nm, 3-dimensional structures with controlled diameter channels, and merging and diverging channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
