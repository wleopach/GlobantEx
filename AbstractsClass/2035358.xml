<AbstractNarration>The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and show potential for deliverables in the near future. The objective of this workshop is to explore topics for potential NSF Convergence Accelerator tracks for FY 2021.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) will convene a workshop on “The Responsible Use of Data During Times of Crisis”, for pandemics as well as other crisis situations. The workshop will bring together US government leaders, international data protection authorities, corporate leaders, technologists, academic researchers and public health experts to examine benefits, risks, and strategies for the collection and protection of data in support of public health initiatives during crises, including for COVID-19. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ensuring that US and global stakeholders leading emergency efforts have the data-based knowledge, tools and governance structures to navigate pandemic challenges is one of the defining public policy issues of our time. This workshop will explore a proposed Convergence Accelerator track to accelerate collaboration among government, industry and academic researchers to make health data effective and usable and achieve positive lasting impact on future preparedness for pandemics and other crisis situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are three-fold: 1) to bring expert knowledge to a diverse audience of policymakers and industry leaders for timely consideration, collaboration and application as appropriate, 2) to address a number of priority research questions across a range of top issues and technologies, and 3) identify challenges, information gaps, and prospective areas for research and development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The C-Accel workshop will proceed as a “virtual conference” designed to engage participants in immersive discussion and consideration of topics/findings from top COVID and data-related issues that emerged from the Privacy &amp; Pandemics educational series organized by FPF. Three discussion pillars will be used as organizing themes: AI-Ethics-Health. The project will produce a coordinated global “roapmap” (white paper) to point the way forward in research directions, practice improvements, and development of privacy-preserving products and services to inform COVID-19 and crisis situation policies and in preparation for future pandemics and other crises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
