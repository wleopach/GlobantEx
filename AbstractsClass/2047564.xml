<AbstractNarration>Quantum technologies promise to further our understanding of nature’s fundamental phenomena, as well as to provide unprecedented infrastructure for powerful computation and safe communication. While there is a multitude of contenders for physical implementation of quantum systems, two desired properties stand out. First, the light-based solutions benefit from the advantage of long-distance connectivity; and second, the solid-state platforms support advantageous device scaling. This proposal explores the intersection of these two paradigms: optically active defects in semiconductors, called color centers. More specifically, the technical part of the project aims to solve a challenging problem of integrating color centers into nanophotonic devices, thus improving the quantum hardware performance for applications in quantum communication, computation and simulation. The educational impact of the project is significant for the training of inclusive quantum workforce. The diverse student population of UC Davis and Yolo County will obtain exposure to quantum photonic programs, thus expanding the pipeline of students trained for STEM careers. Here, the PI and her team will create an interactive quantum educational software, organize outreach activities at a local youth club and a high school, and integrate hands-on research modules in her Quantum Information Technologies graduate course at UC Davis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses integration of color centers with nanophotonic devices in industrially mature substrate of silicon carbide (SiC) for applications in quantum communication, computation and simulation. In order to develop high-performing quantum optical devices, novel fabrication methods will be devised to support angle-etching of SiC. This plan capitalizes on the PI’s quantum nanophotonics expertise, the state-of-the-art cryogenic spectroscopy setup built in her lab, and the unique clean room capabilities of the UC Davis Center for Nano and Micro Manufacturing (CNM2). Novel fabrication methods will be devised to support angle-etching of SiC and realization of high-performing 4H-SiC photonic devices. The devices will be integrated with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers for exploration of quantum light generation and cavity quantum electrodynamics. Photonic design, characterization and experiments, will be performed in the PI’s lab at UC Davis, while the fabrication process development will be assisted by the CNM2 staff. The proposed development of a new generation of photonic devices in SiC will be transformative for the field of quantum photonics. Suspended triangular SiC devices incorporating quantum emitters will be the first of their kind and enable high fidelity quantum operations with color center photons applied in long distance fiber-based quantum communication and measurement-based quantum computing. Studies of multi-emitter cavity quantum electrodynamic systems will explore new approaches to on-chip quantum simulation. The devices developed in this project will also have an impact in the fundamental and applied aspects of quantum and classical photonics, optomechanics, color center-based sensing, and biophotonics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
