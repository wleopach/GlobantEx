<AbstractNarration>Distributed systems are now everywhere, in the form of wired and &lt;br/&gt;wireless communication networks, distributed data-management systems,&lt;br/&gt;social networks, coordinated robots, and controlled transportation&lt;br/&gt;systems; their prevalence and importance will continue to grow.  This&lt;br/&gt;project is developing theory for distributed systems.  Most existing&lt;br/&gt;theory for distributed systems has focused on algorithms that achieve high&lt;br/&gt;performance on relatively well-behaved computing platforms, such as&lt;br/&gt;reliable, static networks or shared-memory multiprocessors.  In&lt;br/&gt;contrast, this project focuses on theory for very badly behaved&lt;br/&gt;platforms such as wireless networks and robot swarms---platforms that&lt;br/&gt;exhibit noise and uncertainty and that change unpredictably over time. &lt;br/&gt;The project considers how one can design good distributed&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for such settings.  The approach is inspired by the&lt;br/&gt;biological world, in which interacting entities, such as cells or&lt;br/&gt;organisms, live in unpredictable environments, and must contend&lt;br/&gt;regularly with noise and change.  Wireless networks and robot swarms&lt;br/&gt;are similar in many ways to social insect colonies (such as ants or&lt;br/&gt;bees).  In spite of their difficult environments, social insects can&lt;br/&gt;solve sophisticated problems, for example, problems of searching,&lt;br/&gt;construction, consensus, and task allocation.  Understanding how they&lt;br/&gt;do this should help computing researchers to design better algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for wireless networks and robots.  Thus, this project combines its&lt;br/&gt;study of algorithms for wireless networks and robot swarms with a&lt;br/&gt;theoretical study of insect colony behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project seeks new algorithms by which ad hoc&lt;br/&gt;wireless networks, robot swarms, and insect colonies can solve&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems of communication, construction, reaching&lt;br/&gt;consensus, estimation, data processing, searching, shape formation,&lt;br/&gt;task allocation, and more.  It also seeks corresponding lower bounds,&lt;br/&gt;especially bounds that highlight the costs of accommodating changes&lt;br/&gt;and uncertainty.  It looks for general insights and principles for&lt;br/&gt;distributed computing in dynamic and noisy settings, including metrics&lt;br/&gt;for measuring tolerance to noise and change, strategies for designing&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, relationships between different models and problems, and&lt;br/&gt;results articulating the inherent costs of accommodating change and&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty.  Algorithms that are studied are mostly probabilistic and&lt;br/&gt;synchronous.  They tend to be simple, and not to use large local state&lt;br/&gt;or elaborate bookkeeping.  Ideally, they should be self-stabilizing,&lt;br/&gt;that is, able to recover starting from arbitrary configurations.  They&lt;br/&gt;may make extensive use of estimation of environmental and system&lt;br/&gt;properties.  The project uses mathematical techniques from distributed&lt;br/&gt;computing theory and probability theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
