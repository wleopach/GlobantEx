<AbstractNarration>This project will bring together a broad group of stakeholders including industry, academia and government covering areas ranging from technical to economics, and other areas related to adoption for a moderated discussion of priorities, collaborative topics and deliverables related to sustainability through deployment of low carbon energy systems. This will provide a framework and path for impactful results that will result in the rapid deployment of sustainable energy paradigms in the short term. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of sustainable energy paradigms that are economically realizable and reliable remains at the forefront of technological development and policy drivers. Important challenges are developing grid-scale energy storage that is reliable and affordable, innovating novel carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS) that is economically feasible, reducing the energy and environmental footprint of chemical conversion, imagining and delivering a decarbonized and affordable industrial energy and a truly circular plastics economy that ensures a zero-waste paradigm. The convergence of advancing science and engineering focusing on issues of energy and sustainability including carbon management, renewable energy and alternate fuels such as hydrogen and energy storage are crucial to drive the energy transition. Moreover, developing the capabilities and competencies of the workforce and the tools that &lt;br/&gt;will enable this transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
