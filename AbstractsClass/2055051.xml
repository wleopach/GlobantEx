<AbstractNarration>Technological innovations and advancements in geographic information systems (GIS) enable better management of land resources. For example, GIS-based agricultural practices enable farmers to increase production and reduce costs by providing tools for monitoring soil properties and crop health. GIS technologies are also used by public land managers to track invasive species and to plan maintenance activities such as controlled burns. The emerging applications of GIS technologies in agroindustry and land management has resulted in the need for technicians with a variety of GIS skills such as ArcGIS, remote data collection, and spatial data presentation. This project at the Cossatot Community College of the University of Arkansas intends to address the need for GIS-trained technicians in southwest Arkansas.  This area is dominated by farmland, interspersed with local, state, and federal public lands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baseline surveys of regional employers indicated that their employees require training in GIS skills, which they use daily on the job.  The employers also indicated that they would give hiring priority to individuals with GIS training.  To meet this workforce need, the project team and faculty will work with an industry advisory board to develop a new Introduction to GIS Technology lab course. This board will also help to design experiential learning opportunities in GIS, including internships with local industry.  The project will provide professional development to help faculty incorporate GIS activities into their teaching, including novice, advanced, and expert GIS skill applications. The project will also create two new courses in GIS and establish a new Certificate of Proficiency in GIS Technology.  UA Cossatot is a Hispanic Service Institution.  Consequently, the project plans to increase participation of Hispanic students in GIS programs by supporting bilingual career coaches and faculty professional development regarding strategies to support diverse students. The project will develop a website to highlight student internships, job shadowing, and career opportunities that require GIS training. It is expected that this model can be adopted and adapted by other community colleges in areas with similar workforce needs. The assessment and evaluation will inform stakeholders in education, agriculture, and the public. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
