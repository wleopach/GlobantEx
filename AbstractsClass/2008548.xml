<AbstractNarration>This project explores the software and hardware foundations that enable dependable communications between networks of batteryless sensor nodes powered solely by ambient energy (energy harvesting). This is particularly challenging since such batteryless nodes usually have intermittent operation, spending a large fraction of their time without sufficient power to operate, depending on the ambient energy conditions. This project will explore two thrusts: (1) developing approaches to establish initial communications between batteryless nodes and (2) developing methods to efficiently maintain communications across periods of no power by developing a shared sense of time between batteryless nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enabling direct communications between batteryless sensor nodes allows development of large-scale networks of batteryless intermittent nodes where two nodes at any location can dependably communicate with each other as long as the network is connected. Such a network of batteryless nodes can be deployed across large areas (e.g., fields, factories, space) and self-sustain without wiring or battery changes to monitor events. The result enables transformative improvements to applications demanding pervasive, long-lived, and autonomous intelligent sensing systems, including industrial automation, infrastructure monitoring, agriculture, environmental sciences, healthcare, defense, and space exploration. The resulting software and hardware systems along with collected energy data of this project will be made publicly available for scientists, engineers, educators, and industry to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
