<AbstractNarration>In the past decades, cities across America’s rust belt have suffered economic decline due to the exodus of manufacturing jobs and have faced a significant shift towards Information and Computational Technology industries. In many cases, the historical residents are being left behind, due to lack of job readiness and the influx of a new workforce into these industries.  The goal of this project is to develop technology that will engage youth in learning computational skills by applying big data analytics to neighborhood problems as well as skills that will allow youth to succeed in the new economy.  The project will equip members of the community in contextually relevant learning experiences to train them as data trustees in their communities, and provide them with a pathway from data literacy to data stewardship and higher education in technology-related fields. The project will target two economically challenged and marginalized neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, engaging youth that have been excluded from the new labor market, and addressing neighborhood issues that arose as part of the economic decline.  Teaching youth to use big data to address community problems will not only build computational skills but also foster a stronger civic identity among participants.  The technology and curriculum developed through this project will be accessible to other communities for a broader implementation of similar programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through partnership with local after-school programs, the project will engage 15 to 18 years-old youth in developing computational thinking through critical data literacy and cultivation of understanding of how data and data-driven technologies influence their lives.  Defining data literacy as “access to, interpret, critically assess, manage, handle, and ethical use of data”, the project aims to understand the learning mechanism of data literacy, including individual and collective learning processes as well as required supporting technology. It will involve developing educational technology to support collaborative learning of data science in an informal learning environment as well as conducting field studies to understand the process of technology-supported community-focused learning of data-science. To understand the efficacy of the developed tools and processes on youth’s learning gain and civic engagement efficacy, the project will collect data by logging actions within the system as well as conducting pre- and post- questionnaires. Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to identify emerging themes in data, and to statistically analyze the patterns in data. The technological advancement is a suite of novel collaborative data literacy tools that provide multiple entry points for participation tailored to different levels of domain-related, metacognitive, and collaborative data literacy competencies. The research contributes to learning sciences understanding of how critical data literacy situated in community context and real world experiences of individuals in marginalized communities can foster technological knowledge, foster the development of a civic identity and motivate a pathway towards higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
