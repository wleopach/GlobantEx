<AbstractNarration>The Conference Integrable Systems in Geometry and Mathematical Physics will be organized at SISSA, Trieste, Italy, July 13-17, 2020.  It is a satellite event to the 8th European Congress of Mathematics:  https://www.8ecm.si/program/satellite-events. The venue of the conference, SISSA is one of the leading European research universities, situated in Trieste, which is one of the most important scientific hubs in Italy.  The meeting will focus on the most recent developments at the crossroads of geometry and dynamical systems, with a special focus on integrable systems and applications to mathematical physics. The notion of integrable system in classical mechanics dates back to Joseph Liouville (1809-1882) and has an illustrious and long history. The modern resurgence of activity was initiated  by the analysis of soliton solutions of nonlinear wave equations like the Korteweg deVries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The conference aims to bring together both leading mathematicians that have contributed and are contributing to the success and dissemination of methods and ideas originating from integrable systems in all areas of mathematics and physics and also junior researchers and graduate students who should take over the lead in this fascinating field in the near future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renewed interest in integrable systems brought along the invention and development of far reaching solution techniques, including the inverse scattering method and the Sato-Segal-Wilson theory of infinite Grassmannians. The notion of integrable systems has since expanded considerably and often refers to a wide range of techniques. The development of techniques and new classes of integrable models has both cross-fertilized and received input from distant areas of mathematics and physics.  There will be two types of presentations: (i) 25-30  plenary talks by leading specialists in the fields of geometry, dynamics, and integrability. (ii) Poster session mostly for young researchers working in the fields, with 10 minutes introductory oral presentation for each of them. The scientific background of the conference is based on relationships between several popular areas of research. Thus, it has a potential to attract young mathematicians,  minorities and women to participate in exciting cross-disciplinary research and look for new applications of their research in other fields of science. The results of this event will be disseminated by the participants from around the world. https://indico.sissa.it/event/41/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
