<AbstractNarration>This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative:  National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center).  The focus of a spectrum research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum. Ten researchers from six universities (Carnegie Mellon University, Iowa State University, Purdue University, University of Kansas, University of New Mexico and Wichita State University) and two government laboratory scientists with diverse background are coming together in this project with the goal of consolidating their on-going spectrum-related Research and R&amp;D efforts under an NSF SII-Center umbrella, to broaden the scope to address Grand Challenges in spectrum allocation, usage and utilization through coordination with collaborators, partners, beneficiaries and stakeholders. The proposed Center has three unique attributes: a. Particular focus on beyond terrestrial (space/satellite) communications, b. Exploration and integration of higher spectrum bands (e.g. W/V bands), and c. Protection of passive spectrum users and scientific missions.  The project also includes a comprehensive broader impact component including curriculum innovation and outreach to under-represented groups in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major activities of the project are the following: Centerâ€™s research will not only focus on terrestrial systems, but also space and satellite communications in higher-frequency spectrum-bands. Moreover, the Center research will specifically focus on both active and passive spectrum users from scientific missions such as those in astronomy, GPS, navigation and telemetry. Through partnerships with low-population density rural communities and native American pueblos, the Center will focus on developing innovative spectrum solutions for areas that lack broadband wireless access (BWA) due to unique regulatory, cultural, economic and market issues. Having established one of the few W/V band communications links anywhere in the world and having access to radio quiet sites such as the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) as a testbed, the Project Team brings unique spectrum-related research capabilities. The Center will focus on three R&amp;D priority areas that can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spectrum utilization through (1) spectrum agility, (2) near real-time spectrum awareness, and (3) adaptive spectrum decision making, which were recommended to the President by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in May 2019. In collaboration with our partners from government labs, the Center will contribute to global standardization and infrastructure enhancement for integrating future W/V band satellite and 5G/6G terrestrial wireless communications that will allow the US to lead the world in spectrum technology, utilization, and commercialization. The University of New Mexico is one of only two Hispanic-Serving Carnegie VH (Very High research activity) classified Research Universities in the nation. As such, establishing this SII-Center will broaden the participation in science of Hispanics and other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
