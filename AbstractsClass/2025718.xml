<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is the development of an environmentally neutral product for control of red imported fire ants (RIFA), aggressive pests that occur in high densities and are specialists of urban, rural, and agricultural habitats, particularly in southern states. The RIFA affects many economic sectors and cause billions of dollars in damage and control costs annually. Their large numbers and potent sting disrupt the quality of life for millions of Americans and 5-10% of these may develop hypersensitivity to their venom, creating significant medical costs. The RIFA reproductive system lead to rapid re-infestation of treated areas; therefore, continuous use of control measures is required, with associated environmental risk. This project will enable commercialization of a new bait that is environmentally neutral and cost competitive. It will be the first new active ingredient for RIFA control in 20 years. Our novel application of masking agents for RIFA control is expected to have a general impact on the discovery of new pest control active ingredients. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will advance the translation of novel active ingredients for effective RIFA pest mitigation. Prior testing has indicated that additives are needed for this type of pesticide. This project will test additives and optimize formulations for field use  of the new ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
