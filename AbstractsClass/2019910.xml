<AbstractNarration>This RAPID project responds to two recents events on the Anatolian fault in Turkey, a magnitude 5.4 slow earthquake and a magnitude 6.8 earthquake in January of 2020. These events are important to understand because they cause signifcant loss of life and damage to buildings and infrastructure. In addition, the fault system is very similar to those in California. Improving our understanding of this earthquake and slow slip event by collecting data from instruments that measure deformation immediately before and after these events is valuable for researchers studying this fault and many others. The lead investigator will be collaborating with local researchers in Turkey as part of this data collection effort. The US community will gain access to the data quickly through the UNAVCO data archive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports rapid response to two events on the Anatolian fault system that happened in quick succession. The lead investigator will download data from 5 non-telemetered extensometers along the fault, and map surface expressions of the rupture. These data will be valuable in understanding slow slip and seismic fault motion in relation to each other, understanding event nucleation and fault slip. The slow slip earthquake persisted for a month causing the North Anatolian fault to slip significantly. The Mw 6.8 earthquake ruptured an 80km segment of the East Anatolian fault. The broader impacts of the work include collaboration with researchers at the Kandilli Observatory in Instanbul, improved understanding of earthquake hazards and rapid data availability to the US research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project in Turkey had two earthquake-related goals and its results are applicable to the study of future earthquakes pending on the San Andreas fault.  The first was to collect data from an NSF-funded array of instruments that recorded a 10 mm slow earthquake event on the North Anatolian fault east of the town of Bolu where a Mw7.2 earthuqake had occurred in 1944.  The setting is similar to the Parkfield earthquake experiment of 2004.  We successfully downloaded data from 7 instruments that showed that the slow earthquake consisted of multiple events that propagated eastward at a rate of 0.7 to 5 mph. The second was to supplement two NSF funded instruments near the Mw6.8 Elazig/Sivrice earthquake on the East Anatolian fault with additional instruments to quantify the process of afterslip.  This showed, firstly that earthquake waves triggered slip minor slip on the fault 30 miles east of the earthquake and that this slip propagated past two of our instruments 18 minutes later at 0.7 mph.  We were able to calculate that the triggering must have started about a quarter mile west of our instruments near where the fault crosses a branch of the Euphrates river.  Secondly, although a snowstorm prevented us from recovering the data for more than 6 months, we found from instruments we installed after the earthquake, that surface slip had been delayed for several days after the mainshock, and that slip was renewed in a subsequent aftershock.   This information has relevance to the anticipated Mw6.8 future Hayward fault earthquake in the Bay Area of California.  It means that underground pipes will be ruptured both during and in the 2-4 months following the Hayward earthquake.   Finally we discovered that gas was expelled from the fault in the weeks following the Sivrice earthquake, and may have been released from considerable depth, thereby, lubricating  fault "afterslip".  This was observed as km-long lines of bubbles rising from the fault beneath the ponded waters of the Euphrates. Suspecting that something similar may have occurred in California we devised a new instrument to record methane, hydrogen, carbon-dioxide and radon gasses expelled from fault zones and have deplyed five of them on the San Andreas fault system in California.  The fault slip instruments were installed by the PI and by two graduate students from Turkey and by a university professor.  It is largely due to this training/collaboration that data were successfully retrieved by these scientific colleagues during the covid pandemic which shut down field work about 6 days after we collected the data in February 2020.
