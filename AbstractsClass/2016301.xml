<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds to partially cover beginning investigator participant costs for the 17th Symposium on Study of Earth’s Deep Interior (SEDI), to be held in Taipei, Taiwan from July 6-10, 2020. Beginning investigators are defined as graduate students, post-docs and, under some circumstances, very junior faculty. SEDI meetings are particularly conducive for beginning investigators as the meetings are small but cross-disciplinary, and they provide ample time for discussion of the pressing scientific questions. The objective of this proposal is to support the next generation of deep Earth scientists. Applications will be broadly solicited through the SEDI listserve, and applicants will be supported based on their abstracts and a statement of their situation. This workshop will contribute to the interdisciplinary education of US graduate students and beginning researchers by fostering dialog with researchers at all levels at a relatively small workshop-style meeting. The international format complements efforts by US national groups such as CIDER and will be useful to those funded under or seeking funding from the NSF CSEDI program. The structure of SEDI and its meetings is intrinsically interdisciplinary, providing many opportunities for intra- and international collaborations on a broad range of topics that contribute to our understanding of the deep earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEDI is an international scientific organization dedicated to the Study of the Earth’s Deep Interior. The ultimate goal of SEDI is an enhanced understanding of the past evolution and current thermal, chemical and dynamical state of the Earth’s deep interior, and of the effect that the interior has on structures and processes observed at the surface of the Earth. The ‘deep interior’ includes the core and lower mantle, but interest often extends to the surface, for example, in the study of mantle plumes or dynamics of descending lithospheric slabs. The scientific questions and problems of interest to SEDI include the geomagnetic dynamo and secular variation, paleomagnetism and the evolution of the Earth’s deep interior, material properties at extreme conditions, structure and dynamics of the core and mantle, core-mantle interactions, and the nature and location of deep geochemical reservoirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
