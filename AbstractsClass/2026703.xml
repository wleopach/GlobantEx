<AbstractNarration>As machine learning (ML) continues to revolutionize the commercial space including vision, speech, and&lt;br/&gt;text recognition, there is a huge anticipation in the scientific community to unlock the power of ML for&lt;br/&gt;accelerating scientific discovery. However, black-box ML models, which rely solely on training data and&lt;br/&gt;ignore existing scientific knowledge have met with limited success in scientific problems, particularly&lt;br/&gt;when labeled data is limited, sometimes even leading to spectacular failures. This is because the black&lt;br/&gt;box ML models are susceptible to learning spurious relationships that do not generalize well outside the&lt;br/&gt;data they are trained for. The emerging paradigm of physics-guided machine learning (PGML), which&lt;br/&gt;leverages the unique ability of ML algorithms to automatically extract patterns and models from data with&lt;br/&gt;guidance of the knowledge accumulated in physics (or scientific theories), aims to address the challenges&lt;br/&gt;faced by black box ML in scientific applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For data science, PGML has the potential to transform ML beyond black-box applications by enabling&lt;br/&gt;solutions that generalize well even on unseen input-output distributions that are different from those&lt;br/&gt;encountered during training, by anchoring ML methods with the scientific body of knowledge. PGML makes a distinct&lt;br/&gt;departure from the conventional view that physics-based models and ML models are developed in&lt;br/&gt;isolation but seldom mixed together. The proposed project is fundamentally different from existing body&lt;br/&gt;of research that attempts to combine ML and domain sciences, e.g., by making use of domain-specific&lt;br/&gt;knowledge in ML algorithms in simplistic ways, or making use of data in the physics-based modeling&lt;br/&gt;process albeit without allowing data to change the functional forms of existing physics-based models.&lt;br/&gt;The tight interplay between data science and the domains of physics and sensing in the project lends itself&lt;br/&gt;naturally to diverse education activities that complement the research tasks outlined by our team. Over the&lt;br/&gt;duration of this one-year project, the team will develop an integrative course at the graduate level on "ML&lt;br/&gt;meets Physics", which explores topical, emerging themes in this interdisciplinary area. Offerings of the&lt;br/&gt;course will draw upon course modules shared between the four universities, such as shared guest videos&lt;br/&gt;and case studies. The physics department at BU has a well-developed "Physics Outreach Project" that&lt;br/&gt;annually performs science exhibitions for elementary schools in Binghamton metropolitan area, for which&lt;br/&gt;the team will create a new exhibition about neural networks and ML. In follow-on work, similar outreach&lt;br/&gt;events will be replicated at schools (Robinson Middle School in Lowell and Metro STEM Middle School&lt;br/&gt;in Columbus). The PIs are committed to increasing the diversity of involvement at various levels of the&lt;br/&gt;training ecosystem impacted by this project, and have planned various coordinated broader impact&lt;br/&gt;activities for inclusion of female and underrepresented minority students as well as faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
