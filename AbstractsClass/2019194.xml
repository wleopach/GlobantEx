<AbstractNarration>This project establishes a computing system that assists researchers at San Diego State University to accelerate their work through ongoing developments in computer processing hardware.  Faculty and students will develop code, most of it currently running on traditional processing units, to take advantage of the enhanced computing power of graphical processing units and field programmable gate arrays, which effectively allow the circuitry of the computer chip to be optimized for specific computing tasks.  Applications hosted on this system include simulations of subterranean carbon dioxide sequestration, the development of new computer programs to identify disease-causing and other organisms in biologically diverse environments, and studies of nuclear structure, brain imaging, the motion of viruses, and engine design.  One of the PIs directs the training of new users, and the infrastructure is incorporated into several courses available to undergraduates and graduate students.  External users can access the resource through the Pacific Research Platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new, high-performance computing cluster offers advanced processor hardware to researchers at San Diego State University and throughout the region. The cluster is optimized to support transfer of existing software developed in-house to processors that promote distributed computing and/or electronic design automation. While accelerating projects and modernizing training in computational methods, this work also informs the Universityâ€™s long-range cyberinfrastructure acquisition plans by quantifying the enhancement of research possible with advanced hardware. 20% of the cluster capacity is reserved for extramural use through the Pacific Research Platform, and 5% for training and coursework to advance workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
