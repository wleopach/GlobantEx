<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by providing novel and important information regarding the impact of K-12 STEM teachers with a doctorate degree and their roles as instructional leaders in their schools and district. By applying research-informed and equitable policies, practices, and structures, the project intends to increase the capacity and expertise of K-8 mathematics teachers to serve as leaders in their schools and districts.  The project has the potential to incentivize, build precedence for, and professionalize the value of mathematics teachers with doctoral degrees in K-12 school settings, where research and practice can be readily linked. The 15 participating teachers will earn a specialized doctorate of education in K-8 Mathematics Education.  They will also attend the University of Central Florida-Orange County Public Schools Teacher Leader Academy. This project aims to advance the impact of participating teachers by increasing their: 1) ability, knowledge, and social justice mindset; 2) mathematical content knowledge; 3) pedagogical content knowledge; and 4) leadership capacity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at the University of Central Florida (UCF) includes partnerships with Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), and City Year Orlando, a nonprofit whose members are young adults from diverse backgrounds serving one year of community service in OCPS as student success coaches. The project has the potential to be a transformative endeavor that will, through the 15 project teachers' dissertation studies, produce a broad collection of needed studies to inform the practical implementation of the four key recommendations outlined in the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Catalyzing Change framework. Organized by three interconnected and synergistic components (e.g., Multilayered Coaching Cycles, Repositioning Mathematics as a Gateway, and Mentoring Underrepresented STEM Education Professionals), the UCF-OCPS Teacher Leader Academy will provide a structure and support for teachers to apply in their urban classroom settings. These structures and supports include the uprooting of inequitable policies, practices, and structures described in Catalyzing Change. The project will serve as an innovative model for empowering STEM teachers with earned doctorates and increasing diversity of teachers in STEM fields. The UCF-OCPS Noyce Teacher Leader Academy aims to directly impact more than 200 additional K-8 mathematics teachers, more than 30 administrators, the estimated 9000 students in the schools where the project's teachers teach, more than 200 City Year Orlando young adults, and 2000 students served by City Year Orlando. Both quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to determine evidence-based outcomes of the project. The project's leadership team will disseminate results of the project through national and regional presentations, refereed journal articles, and a publicly-available website of resources. This Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K- 12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
