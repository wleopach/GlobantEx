<AbstractNarration>This project establishes a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site hosted by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University at Buffalo. Undergraduate students across the nation will work with a group of experienced faculty members and industrial mentors and conduct cutting-edge research in biometrics and authentication during each summer. Biometrics is replacing traditional passwords and becoming the most preferred authentication approach in daily-life scenarios, including mobile applications, banking, and border security. The trend leads to an impressive upsurge in the industry's need to hire scientists and engineers with biometric computing skills. To hardness the biometric technology and meet the increasing industry demand, biometrics and authentication have become a core part of the cybersecurity course curriculum. This REU site will provide a short-term intensive research training experience to a group of undergraduate researchers to prepare them for a career in the field of cybersecurity and benefit their graduate applications and job hunting. Through various activities such as hands-on projects, seminars, demos, presentations, field trips, and other professional development opportunities, undergraduate students will also enhance their professional skills. This REU site aims to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite substantial previous efforts, there remain unresolved challenges about the effectiveness and management of systems for biometric recognition, as well as the appropriateness and societal impacts of their use. Moreover, the general public has been exposed to biometrics largely as high-technology gadgets in spy thrillers or as fear instilling instruments of state or corporate surveillance in speculative fiction. The following research problems in biometrics are challenging and unexplored, but of great importance to trustworthy biometrics: new biometric modality, anti-spoofing, cancelability, continuous authentication, and societal acceptance. The problem formulation and solutions will help the community strengthen the understanding of biometrics in individual identification and authentication. Specifically, under the long-term vision of biometrics and authentication, this REU site will focus on the two fundamental research directions on (A) biometric modality and (B) biometric security. Specifically, the research projects for undergraduate students will be built on top of six (6) research areas under the theme of Biometrics and Authentication, including 1) Biometric Sensors &amp; Hardware, 2) Biometric Data Processing, 3) Authentication Algorithms, 4) Biometrics System Security, 5) User Interface Optimization, and 6) Attacks &amp; Countermeasures. Research outcomes include a set of cutting-edge biometric technologies, including emerging physiological and behavioral biometrics, continuous and revocable authentication, vulnerabilities, and mitigation approaches to new attacks to biometric authentication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
