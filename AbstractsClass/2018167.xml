<AbstractNarration>With this award funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Case Western Reserve University will acquire a variable pressure Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The instrument features detectors and stages integrated with external stimuli that will enable in-operando studies of the evolution of materials, devices, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). This instrument will enhance the research and teaching capabilities across CWRU, and provide a unique resource to the surrounding research community. This instrument will be located in a general user facility, with training and service work managed by highly qualified staff. Users from across Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, and the School of Medicine can explore the fundamental materials science necessary to understand and improve devices ranging from batteries to high-temperature sensors and actuators to thin-film solar cells. The proposed instrument will enhance the student learning experience by giving students access to contemporary imaging techniques useful for research and development across all material systems. In particular, the variable pressure chamber of the proposed instrument reduces the sample preparation needed to characterize insulators, thus allowing undergraduate students to focus on the learning objective of the laboratory course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equipment provides a method to directly observe dynamic mechanisms for the development of models of behaviors and advance our scientific understanding in a broad range of materials research problems. Such unprecedented experiments will lead to new fundamental insights for the development and testing of mechanistically-informed theories, and from them, new design rules and guidelines for rational engineering of materials and devices. In particular, it will enable mechanisms of interface evolution in optoelectronic devices; electrochemical reactions; and microstructural evolution under elevated-temperature conditions in material systems for energy generation. The capability to image insulator material without conductive coating provides a new opportunity to the CWRU materials research community, to explore mechanisms of material synthesis and microstructural evolution that are not currently possible with existing SEM equipment. In particular, understanding how the interfaces of layered and architectured polymer materials control lifetime performance for optoelectronic and energy storage applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
