<AbstractNarration>The 27th NSF EPSCoR National Conference supports the work and mission of NSF EPSCoR. The goals of NSF EPSCoR are to increase research capacity, strengthen STEM education, and advance science and engineering in jurisdictions that have historically received limited funding from NSF. Under the overarching theme of “Translating Stakeholder Needs into Impactful Research Outcomes,” the event will focus on and demonstrate NSF EPSCoR's unique ability to engage stakeholders through broadening impacts, community science projects, educational opportunities, and partnerships. Each jurisdiction will be asked to present on their programs that can be used as national models for creating strategic stakeholder engagement, leading to improved scientific research impacts and educational outcomes. In addition, the conference will serve as a platform for attendees to learn more about NSF EPSCoR and funding opportunities with a special emphasis on Track-2 and 4 proposals. Other strands will include broadening participation in STEM, economic development, convergence science, “pandemic” best practices, and professional development for students. There will be a poster session for students, and a community science showcase for all participants. This conference will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the program, and also to help improve future events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
