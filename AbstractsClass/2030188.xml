<AbstractNarration>This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need. Specifically, this project at the University of Puerto Rico in Piedras will provide 33 students with up to five years of scholarship support, together with targeted services.  The overall project goal is to improve recruitment, retention of undergraduates pursuing bachelor?s degrees in computer science or mathematics and prepare them for employment or graduate school. This program will increase the number of Puerto Rican students who enter the scientific career pipeline in the high demand disciplines of computer science and mathematics. As a result, the project can help to meet the expanding need for these professionals and increase the diversity of  the workforce in STEM-relevant sectors both locally and nationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing scholarships to high achieving, financially disadvantaged undergraduate students, the project will sponsor activities to: 1) increase the awareness of Scholars about further studies or industry careers; 2) strengthen the Scholars? academic and professional skills; 3) build a sense of community and develop scientific identity; 4) highlight the social and applied aspects of computer science and mathematics; and 5) support student learning through peer advisors and mentoring. This project will expand the research focus of previous S-STEM awards by: (1) including Scholars as early as their second semester in college; (3) improving the coordination and coherence of group activities, and support Scholars in the barrier courses with periodic peer-led collaborative interventions; and (3) studying impact of the Peer-Led Team Learning model on Scholar retention and academic performance. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
