<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an implantable medical device to facilitate the regeneration of skeletal muscle to reduce unnecessary suffering and cost from long-term disability following traumatic muscle injuries. This device may change the standard of care for large muscle injuries and save limbs that otherwise would be amputated. This project will explore the translation of technologies that restore muscle and limit disability in 65,000 annual gunshot victims; 110,000 annual open fracture victims; and 10,000 annual active duty service personnel suffering with traumatic muscle injuries in the US. In addition, the technology may have applications in veterinary medicine to help veterinarian surgeons improve the quality of life for traumatic injuries in pets and livestock. There are more than 158,000 muscle injuries in dogs alone within the US and Canada every year. A successful entrance into the veterinarian market may provide additional safety and efficacy data for a future FDA clearance for human use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a 3D biomaterial that will enable surgeons to treat large muscle injuries and improve functional outcomes.  The proposed device is an extracellular replacement therapy to facilitate functional and aesthetic healing of skeletal muscle injuries. The proposed technology is based on proteins normally found in developing muscles, and a 3D porous structure that allows cells to attach while filling the entirety of the injury. The mechanical properties physically prevent the wound from collapsing on itself, and the interconnected porous structure allows for cellular infiltration of remaining skeletal muscle cells and immune cells. The product is designed to be shelf stable and fit within a surgeonâ€™s pre-existing surgical routine.  A single device may be cut to fit the specific defect and return the muscles' natural contour. Previous studies have shown an improvement in muscle function by 52%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
