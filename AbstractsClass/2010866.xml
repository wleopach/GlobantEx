<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Locating, identifying, and selecting suitable mates is a fundamental challenge common to all life. These important aspects of reproduction are often accomplished through chemical communication involving pheromones. Thus, the chemical sense of smell used to detect pheromones is important to successful animal reproduction. African giant pouched rats possess a powerful sense of smell which allows them to communicate using a complex system of pheromone signals. These pheromones are used to pass detailed information to one another about gender, age, reproductive features and quality as potential mates. Despite the importance, little is known about how this information is passed using pheromones or what physical mechanisms are used to detect and interpret these signals. This research seeks to answer these questions and represents the first steps toward establishing a unique rodent model of reproduction and chemical communication that will advance the understanding of how appropriate mates are identified. The fellow will broaden participation within the scientific community by including undergraduate student researchers at the beginning of their careers and through collaborative international field research involving students and researchers from Sokoine University of Agriculture in Morogoro, Tanzania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing an integrative approach combining behavioral, physiological and molecular evidence, this research seeks to describe the genetic and biological substrates facilitating detection, identification and evaluation of potential mates in the African giant pouched rat. First, the genetic potential for expression of vomeronasal chemical receptor proteins will be investigated using in-silico genomic analyses comparing receptor repertoires of related species to identify biologically relevant genes and provide insight regarding the relative biological importance of the vomeronasal chemosensory system of the pouched rat. Next, high throughout RNA-sequencing will be used to examine expression of vomeronasal and olfactory chemical receptors and describe variation by gender, developmental phenotype, or reproductive status suggestive of optimization of sensitivity toward biologically relevant chemical stimuli. This research component will be conducted in collaboration with Sokoine University of Agriculture using animals from natural Tanzanian populations. Lastly, behavioral assays will determine the specific roles of the vomeronasal and main olfactory chemosensory systems, and how these systems interact to facilitate chemical communication and reproduction. Mentoring students and collaboration with scientists in Tanzania will broaden the impact of this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
