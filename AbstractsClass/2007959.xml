<AbstractNarration>Problems in science are often reduced to mathematical equations.&lt;br/&gt;There are many computer programs for solving various types of equations.&lt;br/&gt;The equations themselves often come from computer computation, so they&lt;br/&gt;can be large. This project aims to simplify large equations, reducing them&lt;br/&gt;when possible to smaller ones that can be solved more easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When computers construct formulas and equations to tackle problems in science,&lt;br/&gt;their first expressions need not be the simplest ones. It is likely that simpler formulas&lt;br/&gt;or equations exist. Finding them makes subsequent computations easier and faster.&lt;br/&gt;The types of equations that this project aims to simplify are differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;recurrence relations, and algebraic equations in two variables. A common theme for&lt;br/&gt;each of these types of equations is that in order to simplify them, a key step is a&lt;br/&gt;technical analysis of their singularities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer algebra systems can automatically find exact solutions for various types&lt;br/&gt;of equations. They are an important part of the infrastructure for research&lt;br/&gt;and education. However, they often produce unnecessarily complicated answers.&lt;br/&gt;The techniques developed in this project will help to simplify not only equations,&lt;br/&gt;but solutions as well, making them more useful for research and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
