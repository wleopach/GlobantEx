<AbstractNarration>This project supports the Advancing Health Through Science: Principal Investigators Workshop in Alexandria, VA on January 6-7, 2020. The meeting will bring together principal investigators of projects awarded by the Smart and Connected Health (SCH) program with other researchers looking at smart health in the broader community. The SCH program was set up in order to bridge gaps in fundamental science necessary to transform health and healthcare, as well as to be focused on prevention and person-centered care. Advancing Health through Science Workshop is designed to address the next generation of challenges in advancing health with foundational research from the computer science, engineering and the social, behavioral and economic disciplines. An objective of the Workshop is to provide an opportunity for the principal investigators and other smart health researchers to explore research progress in a diverse set of projects and discuss important current issues, as well as future challenges associated with research in transdisciplinary scientific areas. The discussions will be supported by keynotes, panels, project-related posters, rapid talks and cross-discipline participant-generated workshops. It is anticipated that the meeting will stimulate discussions, connections, and collaborations that will facilitate progress in the area of Smart and Connected Health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop should have a significant impact on the participants and the future of the SCH program. The focus of the workshop is on foundational research that supports the growth of smart health within connected communities. The workshop results are likely to include new research directions that will be publicized to the research community through publications and a workshop website. The results dissemination should inform and the developing Smart and Connected Health research community in their transdisciplinary collaboration, educational activities, and spur other innovative research directions. The broader impacts of the workshop are to facilitate progress in the field and stimulate conversations, connections, and collaborations that will lead toward better informed and effective smart and connected health research and resulting technologies for the broadest possible user populations. In order to address current concerns in Smart and Connected Health research, such as cybersecurity and privacy, the meeting will include a cross-discipline workshops with the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace research community. Additionally, there will be a workshop attached to the Principal Investigator meeting that will support the travel for ten students to attend the PI Workshop. This should also help grow the field by providing mentorship and support for a new cadre of investigators looking to do work in the Smart and Connected Health area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop brought together over 200 attendees from computing, engineering and/or health researchers to discuss research progress, challenges, and future directions in Smart and Connected Health. This year, we had a total of 217 attendees, including 140 SCH funded PIs, 34 aspiring PIs, 5 Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) PIs, 10 student awardees, 20 federal attendees from NSF and NIH and other government agencies. One of the goals of the workshop was to broaden the pool of researchers and to generate new collaborative teams. This workshop brought together computing, engineering, biomedical and clinical research communities, to explore challenges and opportunities to build productive collaboration between computer scientists, engineers and biomedical and clinical researchers. This workshop included two lightening talk sessions from funded PIs, aspiring PIs, and student awardees; poster sessions from 170+ attendees; four expert panels: &lsquo;Scientific gaps in remote and ambulatory monitoring&rsquo;, &lsquo;Using human efficiently in the technology loop&rsquo;, &lsquo;AI needs for the future and intelligence systems&rsquo;, &lsquo;secure and private smart health&rsquo;; four mini workshops: &lsquo;cross-disciplinary secure and trustworthy cyberspace workshop&rsquo;, &lsquo;smart connected health aspiring PIs&rsquo;, &lsquo;Medical cyber physical systems&rsquo;, &lsquo;building teams between researchers in human-compute interaction and the behavioral and social sciences&rsquo;; two keynote speech, and one networking event. Attendees joined presentations given by speakers from SCH PIs, NSF, NIH, other government agencies, and private industries. They benefited from breakout discussions, resource presentations and demonstrations, and poster sessions showcasing all of the research projects. The meeting provided attendees novel ways of approaching collaborations, access to new and existing resources, and models for conceptualizing research from novel, fundamental, basic science to the bedside and to communities of end users.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/14/2020<br>      Modified by: Yingzi (Lynn)&nbsp;Lin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
