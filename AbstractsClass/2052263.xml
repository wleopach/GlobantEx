<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate proof-of-concept for a new clean energy technology that uses protein nanostructures to serve as a safe alternative, or supplement, to traditional batteries. The goal is to create power units that are 100% recyclable, preventing toxic electronic waste from accumulating in landfills, and that generate continuous power, reducing the direct and labor costs associated with replacing traditional batteries.  These costs are a significant hurdle that slows the widespread adoption and use of low-power, high-value electronics such as networks of industrial Internet of Things (IoT) sensors.  The project may also address applications, such a flammable gas sensors, where traditional batteries are not typically used to due to safety concerns.  This Phase 1 project is focused on the initial development of a safe and sustainable replacement for batteries using a technology that provides continuous renewable energy and is made with non-toxic recyclable materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing a prototype device that uses protein nanostructures to generate clean power by means of a new method of energy harvesting that leverages environmental humidity. The research objectives are to (i) fabricate standardized, reliable and reproducible testbed devices; (ii) demonstrate the feasibility of commercial-scale production of a range of protein nanostructures; and (iii) to evaluate these protein nanostructures using our testbed devices. The testbed prototype devices will be made using commercially scalable processes. Devices made using the protein nanostructures will be evaluated using electrochemical and electronic characterization techniques.  The goals of the project are to successfully fabricate thin-film power generation devices, prove commercial-scale production of protein nanostructures, evaluate the power output, and demonstrate a novel mechanism of action of power generation from the devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
