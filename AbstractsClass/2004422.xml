<AbstractNarration>Progress in the fields of materials science, nanotechnology, healthcare, and communications all require precise control and understanding of light interaction with nanoscale objects. Unfortunately, the phenomenon known as the diffraction limit prevents focusing of light to areas smaller than approximately half the wavelength of the light. For thermal (mid-infrared) radiation, the diffraction limit-scale is roughly five microns, much larger than 10-100â€™s-nanometer size of semiconductor electronic components, viruses, and other objects of interest. In this collaborative research the investigators develop novel structures, photonic funnels, that eliminate the diffraction limit and efficiently guide the optical signals between free space and nano-scale areas. Theoretically, the investigators develop equations and computer codes to model propagation of light through the funnels, as well as the emission of light by nanoscale objects positioned within, and in proximity to, the funnels. Experimentally, the researchers develop procedures to fabricate the funnels, integrate light emitters, and analyze light propagation through, and from, these structures. The exploration and development of these novel composite materials have the potential to open new avenues in high-resolution probing of biological, electronic, and optical structures, and in engineering optical interactions with these structures. In addition, the investigators plan for outreach and educational activities aimed at both high-school and college-level students, as well as personnel exchange and training across the disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project aims to address one of the fundamental limits of light-matter interaction, the diffraction limit. The research team utilizes recently developed composite optical materials with highly doped plasmonic inclusions, hyperbolic metamaterials, and develops tools for the design, fabrication, and analysis of conical structures with hyperbolic cores, photonic funnels, in the important mid-infrared frequency range. The strong dielectric anisotropy of hyperbolic materials postpones the onset of the diffraction limit inside the funnels and thus enables propagation of light between micro- and nano-scales. The research team analyzes, theoretically and experimentally, light-matter interaction inside, and in close proximity to, the photonic funnels. Specifically, the team develops theoretical tools capable of accurate modelling of light generation from within, and in the near field of, the funnels, as well as of light propagation through the funnels. In parallel, the team develops fabrication and characterization procedures to accurately control the geometry of the funnels and to understand their optical response. The collaborative feedback within the team enables comprehensive development of a novel material platform offering unique opportunities for light manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
