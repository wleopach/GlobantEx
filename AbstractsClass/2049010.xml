<AbstractNarration>Data science and analysis have taken a center stage in modern years for a swath of applications&lt;br/&gt;embracing daily life. In general, AI and machine learning have been the backbone of this&lt;br/&gt;development. Recently, a technique based on the classical mathematical area of topology has evolved&lt;br/&gt;that is showing promise to complement and in some cases be an alternative to AI techniques. As this&lt;br/&gt;emergent area, known as topological data analysis (TDA), expands its reach, the task of extracting&lt;br/&gt;intelligent summaries out of diverse, complex data becomes increasingly challenging. To meet this&lt;br/&gt;challenge, TDA also needs to expand its current repertoire of techniques by making further and&lt;br/&gt;deeper connections between mathematical and algorithmic concepts. This project aims to develop&lt;br/&gt;these techniques while training graduate students and other workforce in data science as a&lt;br/&gt;consequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, in particular, will investigate several novel mathematical concepts in conjunction with&lt;br/&gt;computations to address various challenges appearing in the following topics: (i) augmenting&lt;br/&gt;topological summarization with geometry, (ii) connecting discrete Morse theory to further&lt;br/&gt;applications, (iii) developing persistence theory for combinatorial dynamical systems, and (iv)&lt;br/&gt;developing multi-parameter persistence from a computational view-point. A successful algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;theory supported by sound mathematics for the four aforementioned themes can provide a powerful&lt;br/&gt;tool for data exploration and analysis in a spectrum of engineering and scientific fields. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed outreach activities will also further consolidate the ongoing effort of bringing together&lt;br/&gt;different communities in science and engineering engaged into modern data analysis. The project&lt;br/&gt;will help train graduate students who will develop skills in mathematics and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science, most notably in algorithms and topology, in writing efficient and usable software,&lt;br/&gt;and in its application to analyzing real-world data sets. Efforts will be made to recruit and mentor&lt;br/&gt;students from under-represented groups, as has already been done by the investigator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
