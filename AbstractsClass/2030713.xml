<AbstractNarration>This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at the University of the Virgin Islands, a Historically Black University.  Over its five-year duration, the project will provide two-year scholarships to thirty-six unique full-time graduate students who are pursuing a Master of Science in Marine and Environmental Science degree.  The selected Scholars will also have a demonstrated interest in natural resource conservation in the Caribbean.  The project aims to increase student success in STEM fields by linking scholarships with effective supporting activities, including mentoring, research experiences, service learning, outreach projects, professional development, and participation in discipline-specific conferences. By analyzing the effectiveness of student recruitment, curriculum, and co-curricular activities, the project will identify practices with high impact for low-income students and adapt them to maximize their effect.  The Scholars will conduct research that has regional significance, partner with potential employers, and share their research results.   Broad dissemination of the project’s findings can enable it to serve as a model for graduate student recruitment and support services of low income, academically talented students in other programs at the University and at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.  The specific goals of this project are to increase recruitment of Virgin Islanders in the master of marine and environmental sciences program, investigate conditions under which improved student learning occurs, promote successful post-graduate employment, and share the knowledge for broader impact.  Additional project aims include analysis and improvement of recruitment strategies to include low income Virgin Island students, as well as students from populations that are under-represented in this STEM field.  The scope of this project also includes faculty development workshops to address best practices for mentoring and advising of low-income students, as well as professional development training and professional partnering for the students.  Potential outcomes include increased recruitment and graduation, and successful post-graduate employment of the Scholars.  An external evaluator, provided by The Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR), will assess this project using an approach that includes project document review and stakeholder surveys.  NSF S-STEM Program initiatives will be bolstered through integration with the VI-EPSCoR project on undergraduate resilience education research, connecting freshman-level UVI students with co-curricular activities, service-learning projects, and community partners involved in this master of marine and environmental sciences initiative. This project is funded by NSF’s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
