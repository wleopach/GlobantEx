<AbstractNarration>Supported by the NSF Division of Engineering Education and Centers, this REU Site develops capacity in an area of national priority by increasing the number of individuals with expertise and creative problem-solving abilities in the field of aging civil infrastructure. This program addresses a critical need for research and training while targeting the needs of traditionally underserved and underrepresented groups of neurodiverse students in engineering programs, including those with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and/or dyslexia, who are at high risk of academic failure. The REU Site will directly benefit participants by providing a positive research experience that recognizes and builds on their unique strengths to improve their self-image, encourages their persistence in engineering careers, and enhances their participation in engineering research. Additionally, the program aims to increase understanding of the challenges of neurodiverse students in traditional engineering education settings.  This knowledge provides a foundation for the future development of specialized programs that increase participation and foster the unique assets of this underrepresented group. The principal investigators will use formal and informal opportunities to inform engineering researchers and educators about the program to promote awareness about the unique talents and diverse learning needs of neurodiverse students within the engineering community. The information disseminated through this project may contribute to a change in how neurodiverse individuals are perceived by our society and our education system. It may lead to significant enhancement in the wellbeing of these individuals and their families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique program nurtures the out-of-the-box thinking potential of neurodiverse students to advance radical solutions to the problems facing the nation’s aging water, power, or transportation infrastructure. This is accomplished by promoting the application of big data, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in tackling the engineering challenges caused by the interconnectivity, interdependency, and complexity of infrastructure systems. The magnitude of the problem demands advancing nontraditional, data-driven assessment methods and highlights the potential for incorporating AI and data-driven damage quantification methods in decision-making processes. The knowledge gained and solutions developed will establish the application of AI as a powerful tool for addressing the complex and pressing challenges posed by our nation’s aging infrastructure. This project capitalizes on the untapped strengths of an underserved population to promote creativity by encouraging novel, transformative, and radical approaches. The knowledge generated through this project regarding the experience of neurodiverse students and the obstacles they face in traditional engineering education and research settings may significantly encourage future research in learning environments and workforce development. It is anticipated that this work may also contribute to the development of more inclusive engineering programs for neurodiverse students. If retained, trained, and mentored, this underserved population of students presents significant potential to benefit society in areas in which innovation and creativity are most needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
