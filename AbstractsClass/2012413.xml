<AbstractNarration>It is well known that protons and neutrons are made from constituents, called quarks and gluons, which make up the substructure of protons and neutrons. The goal of this project is to make measurements of the position and momentum distributions of the quarks and build a three-dimensional map of quarks in the nuclear medium. This knowledge provides the basis of our understanding of nuclear matter in terms of the dynamics of their internal constituents. Using this information, theoretical models show how the constituent parts of the proton and neutron can be used to build up their fundamental intrinsic properties, such as their overall size and quantum mechanical spin.  This award will support two undergraduate students each year as they learn both hardware and software skills that will prepare them for careers in the STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project engages the PI and Duquesne University's undergraduate students in research aimed at the study of  parton distributions using semi-inclusive production of pions and kaons with CLAS12 at Jefferson Lab. Data taking and analysis for unpolarized and polarized deuterium and hydrogen targets are part of this project.  In addition, the PI will lead the efforts in software development, characterization, reconstruction, and calibration as the analysis coordinator of a second hybrid ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) which is under construction.  This detector will identify in the momentum range of 3 to 8 GeV/c.  Undergraduates play an integral part in this project, which provides them with opportunities to further their training and education outside of the classroom. This will include:  gaining experience in the design, assembly, and testing of modern particle physics detectors, high tech fast electronics, and scientific data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
