<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Kansas, located in Lawrence, KS, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024.  Students will formulate their research plans with their mentors, spend the majority of their time on a research project, and will present their findings in a university-wide Research Symposium at the end of summer.  The underlying aim is to provide students with a strong basis and incentive for pursuing careers in research, with a specific goal of increasing diversity and participation in the sciences. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, or from underrepresented groups, will be trained in the program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mentor-directed scientific activities will be performed in the Department of Molecular Biosciences in faculty labs in the fields of biochemistry, cell, molecular and developmental biology, virology and microbiology, and computational biology.  In the context of the common research theme of “Stress,” students will learn how environmental and biological conditions may affect development, function, and survival of cells and organisms, as well as the nature of stress response mechanisms.  Examples of student projects may involve use of genetically tractable organisms (Drosophila, C. elegans) to model evolution of stress responses or neurological responses to stress, use of modified infectious agents (bacteria, coronavirus) in studies of host/pathogen interactions and mechanisms, and biochemical analysis of infection-associated strategies in microorganisms (T3SS, quorum sensing).  Weekly programs and social activities will develop student career progression, foster independence as a scientist, hone presentation skills, and foster community.  Students will attend interactive workshops on responsible conduct of research, scientific writing, and applying to graduate school.  Assessments of the program will be performed using the SALG URSSA tool.  Program members and faculty will maintain continued communications with participants as they plan for conference presentations and prepare for graduate school, allowing their career trajectories to be assessed. Participants should have completed freshman biology and chemistry, and must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.  More information about the program is available at mbreu.ku.edu, or by contacting the PI, Dr. Lisa Timmons, at mb-reu@ku.edu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
