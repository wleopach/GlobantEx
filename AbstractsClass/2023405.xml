<AbstractNarration>America's private and public sectors work hard to improve national security, economic growth, and quality of life for people around the world. In an increasingly competitive global environment, American competitiveness often depends on analyzing the best available data and evidence in ways that are rigorous and actionable. Our military, our farms, our factories, our tech companies, and our governments benefit from analyses that document the effect of past and current programs and provide a credible basis for improving future effectiveness and efficiency. The EITM (Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models) program is designed to help young scholars develop research designs in ways that advance critical scientific knowledge and that make that knowledge more relevant and usable to the private and public sector. EITM pursues these goals by providing opportunities for scholars to better leverage possible intersections between theoretical modeling and empirical inference. For example, today sophisticated methods for examining qualitative data, text, "big data", networks and related phenomena are drawing scholars' attention. EITM his attention increases the opportunities for, and headwinds facing, theory-empirical integrations. A new approach to EITM can help scholars increase the credibility and value of the knowledge that they are now producing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EITM Summer Institutes offer younger scholars an opportunity to work with senior scholars who are leaders in advancing theoretical and empirical research. The content of Institute activities pertains to the development and expansion of best practices. The substantive focus is on areas where appreciable research integrating theory and methods already exists. Institute activities transcend passive receipt of lecture material. Each institute offers participants multiple dynamic opportunities to receive mentoring and feedback from a wide range of sources. Each institute combines a rigorous curriculum with a wide range of one-to-one mentoring opportunities with leading faculty from across the country. EITM is committed to making these opportunities available to people from all backgrounds. We have worked with other groups to deal with the fact that aspiring members of historically underrepresented populations often desire the benefits of an EITM experience, but lack confidence that their institutions have adequately prepared them. EITM's expanded Scholarship program gives us the ability to be proactive in building new opportunity pipelines for such individuals. In short, EITM emphasizes addressing important substantive and methodological problems with a combination of clearly-stated premises, logically coherent theory explaining relations among concepts named in the premises, and a logically coherent empirical work developed to evaluate the premises and/or the relations. Society benefits when its members can develop, articulate, and apply logically-coherent and empirically robust explanations of critical social phenomena. Dealing with such questions directly, as EITM does, is a means to new levels of accuracy and reliability for the growing range of private and public sector entities that use social science to improve their effectiveness and efficiency. Developing a generation of scholars who are up to helping the nation effectively confront its most significant challenges and to make the most of its evolving opportunities is the main goal of the EITM approach.</AbstractNarration>

Science can make our factories, offices, and farms more efficient and can be used to increase the effectiveness of military and public health strategies.<br /><br />The EITM program seeks to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of a wide range of publicly-oriented scientific research. It does so by training young scholars to conduct research that is scientifically rigorous, empirically accurate, and stated in ways that are actionable for public and private sector decision makers. The training focuses on how to develop rigorous models of strategic interaction alongside empirical research designs that can help us evaluate the effectiveness of models and strategies. In practice, however, many theories are produced without sufficient reference to empirical knowledge to motivate their assumptions or to evaluate their logical implications. Similarly, empirical results are often interpreted as having clear substantive implications despite the absence of well specified theories to ground analytic and interpretative claims. Without sufficient interaction of theory and empirics, discoveries are more difficult to translate and apply to critical social contexts. The EITM summer institutes address this gap by offering younger scholars opportunities to learn from, and work with, more senior scholars who are leaders in advancing theoretical and empirical research.<br /><br />The Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (EITM) Summer Institutes 2016-2019 have aimed to:<br /><br />1. Improve scholars' ability to leverage interactions between theoretical models that clarify complex logical relations and empirical strategies that clarify important properties of data generating processes.<br /><br />2. Provide training and development for young scholars to acquire these skills through EITM Summer Institutes.<br /><br />3. Expand and diversify the pool of students who can benefit from EITM institutes through the certification and scholarship programs and related activities.<br /><br />4. Continue the Mentoring Faculty-in-Residence (MFR) program that helps junior faculty better develop EITM content at their home institutions.<br /><br />During the grant period, we provided training to 108 students and 11 MFRs during four summer institutes held at:</p> <p>-Duke University, June 13 to July 1, 2016; 30 participants and 4 MFRs<br /><br />-University of California Berkley, June 26 to July 14, 2017; 30 participants and 3 MFRs<br /><br />-University of Michigan, June 25 to July 13, 2018; 23 participants and 2 MFRs<br /><br />-Emory University, July 1 to July 19, 2019; 25 participants and 2MFRs<br /><br />Training at each institute included significant teaching and research components, providing students a high degree of individualized interaction with a far wider and deeper array of EITM mentors than are available at any individual institution. We employed an array of technologies to increase the number of small group and one-on-one contacts between students, faculty, and mentors. Other direct benefits included the dissemination of improved research and Internet-based course materials such as EITM syllabi, lecture notes, homework exercises, demonstrations, replication datasets, and working papers.<br /><br />Since 2011, EITM has been in partnership with the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research, housed at the Institute for Social Research. As part of this partnership,&nbsp; EITM offers a scholarship program and a certification program to help encourage participation in the EITM Summer Institutes from a greater diversity of students.
