<AbstractNarration>This award supports planning for a large-grant project addressing the scalability issue among heterogeneous memory and storage systems that are composed of many parallel memory banks and disks, specifically for big-data and deep-learning applications. Emerging big-data and learning applications significantly increase both frequency and volume of data transfers over time in computer systems, which consequently result in non-negligible contention and load-imbalance issues among large-scale parallel memory storage systems. Such concerns can derail computing scalability.  To grow to the requisite scale for real-world impact, there is a need for a cross-layer approach that optimizes the entire hardware/software stack. This project supports an interdisciplinary planning process, with researchers from computer architecture, high-performance computing (HPC), security and privacy, systems, and algorithms. This project will also contribute to society through engaging under-represented groups from a Hispanic Serving Institution and research dissemination for computer science and engineering education and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant will plan to build a research team with the capability to address the interdisciplinary scalability challenges to large-scale heterogeneous memory and storage systems. The PIs exploit application hints such as additional sampling flexibility at the full hardware/software stack to reduce the amount of data-transfer traffic among memory and Input/Output. This is intended to realize the ultimate objective, namely maintaining a shared-nothing architecture in low-level memory and storage and thus achieving high scalability. Specific research thrusts are:  1) conducting workload and application-characteristics studies for various applications such as autonomous driving and high-performance computing,  2) exploring an innovative way to develop an application-aware, data-centric task scheduler for parallel memory banks and disks to achieve high-scalability, 3) developing several machine-learning algorithms to enhance task scheduling, and 4) investigating the applications of homomorphic encryption for sensitive datasets in data analytics and sampling applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
