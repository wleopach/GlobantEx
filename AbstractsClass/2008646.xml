<AbstractNarration>Extended reality (XR) technologies, encompassing virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality, will immerse users in virtual worlds with unprecedented interactivity across multiple domains ranging from gaming to sports and entertainment. However, to date, XR technologies have mostly relied on wired connectivity, which restricts their use to small spaces and narrows their application domains. In contrast, the goal of this research is to unleash the potential of XR technologies by marrying them with seamless wireless connectivity. As a result, this research will potentially enable users to use XR applications on-the-go without being confined to indoor environments and having to carry cumbersome cable-connected XR equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This goal is achieved by developing a holistic framework for enabling XR over wireless networks by symbiotically integrating rigorous theory with real-world communication system design considerations. A key component of this framework is the development of precise quality-of-experience metrics that combine objective wireless quality-of-service indicators with subjective XR user experience measures using tools from utility theory. These metrics are then integrated into novel resource management algorithms that merge concepts from reinforcement learning and reservoir computing to guarantee seamless XR quality-of-experience and adapt the network to XR user dynamics. The developed solutions are validated in realistic environments using a combination of simulations and user experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute towards accelerating the deployment of wireless XR technologies and applications thus having tangible societal impacts. A well-crafted educational plan focused on wireless XR will be developed and will include curriculum development as well as involvement of students in research and hands-on projects. Broadening participation outreach events will be organized as part of existing summer camps and will include seminars and hands-on activities that can expose the community to wireless XR technologies, in general, and the outcomes of this research, in particular. Workshops focused on wireless XR will be organized for broad dissemination. Outcomes of this project will be posted at https://sites.google.com/view/nsfcns2008646project/home&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
