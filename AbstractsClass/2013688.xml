<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract: The Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School and Workshop focuses on the synthesis, characterization and electronic modelling of quantum materials.  The program includes two major elements: i) the school providing pedagogical training to students and early career scientists, and ii) a workshop event organized to maximize the exposure of participants to the forefront of current research into quantum materials, including presentations and laboratory visits. This approach results in an impactful mix of pedagogical background and practical training for junior scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: The program begins with a school program during which undergraduate and graduate students as well as junior scientists/postdocs receive instruction in quantum materials synthesis and characterization, and is followed by a one-day workshop attended by all school attendees where senior researchers present high-level talks on recent developments. The lectures are recorded and publicly available online. In 2020 the school will concentrate on the topic of "Exotic and Topological Superconductors" and will feature leading experts as invited lecturers. The structure of the school includes mornings of pedagogical lectures with afternoons devoted to practical demonstrations in laboratories in the University of Maryland's Quantum Material Center. The school also includes a visit to the NIST Center for Neutron Research in Gaithersburg, MD, and a poster session attended by senior scientists. The Winter School is committed to diversity and inclusion, and has been proactive in promoting the participation of junior scientists and underrepresented minorities in quantum materials research. An active public outreach effort is implemented to share learning materials with members of the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
