<AbstractNarration>Globally important carbon (C) stores in northern (boreal) peatlands are vulnerable to changes in altered precipitation and runoff patterns, groundwater inputs, and changes in the extent of frozen ground in high latitudes (called ‘permafrost’, or the ‘cryosphere’).  These changes can affect the extent of boreal wetlands as well as their ability to sequester and transform C and other nutrients. In 2005, the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) was created to examine the role of changing soil climate and vegetation on peatland C cycling. Over the past fifteen years, core data has been collected on soil moisture and temperature, plant composition and amount, and the fluxes of important atmospheric gases emitted (as methane and carbon dioxide) from water table treatments that simulate floods and droughts. A key result from this group's prior investigations was that C emissions from this experimental site appeared to be high, regardless of water table position, revealing that interactions among changes in plant species composition in response to the treatments were strongly controlling the ability of this ecosystem to retain C.  This is a five-year renewal of a Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) project, DEB-1354370. The study is examining the interactions among changes in hydrology, plant species composition and changes in climate (particularly flooding and drought) in controlling C storage in this peatland complex; this work is necessary for understanding the consequences of an altered climate for C cycle processes.  Undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will all be trained and in field and laboratory techniques. Results from the research will also be incorporated into new high school curricula for use in the Fostering Science summer camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current view of peatland carbon cycling is that the majority of soil carbon mineralization occurs in the relatively shallow aerated peat layer above the water table (acrotelm), and that deeper peat carbon occurring in anoxic layers (catotelm) undergoes minimal decomposition. As such, the position of the water table (and the associated thickness of the acrotelm) is used as a predictor of overall decomposition rates and long-term peat accumulation rates. However, findings from this team's fifteen-year manipulation of water table position in an Alaskan fen (Alaska Peatland Experiment, APEX) challenge this view, and in particular suggest that carbon mineralization in saturated peat is faster than previously expected, leading to high fluxes of anaerobic CO2 production. Prior analyses indicated no significant effect of water table position on ecosystem respiration, but it is possible that this result was due at least partially to changes in vegetation that have occurred both under lower (drier) and higher (wetter) water table positions. The initial experimental design could not disentangle the effects of changes in vegetation from hydrology on peat redox and C fluxes. As such, understanding the interactive effects of altered hydrology and vegetation on anaerobic decomposition processes, and how this governs the turnover of deep soil C pools in peatlands, was the prime objective of the first phase of LTREB funding. Results during that initial LTREB funding period showed that sedge and Equisetum (horsetail) rhizospheres indeed had oxidizing effects on peat and dissolved organic matter. However, persistent flooding over this period of research has presented key gaps in mechanistic understanding of controls on trace gas production in this system, and revealed that plant community structure and the dominance of algae likely have unique controls on soil redox processes and C fluxes. Flooding history also exerted strong control over the relative activity of algae vs. heterotrophic microorganisms, depending on changes in C substrates from different plants. Exactly how changes in plant community interact with altered water tables in governing the supply of electron donors and acceptors, and how this controls anaerobic metabolism in low- and high-water table years, are key questions this collaborative team will examine in the next five years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
