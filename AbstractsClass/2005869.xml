<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. This Pilot and Feasibility study will  build foundational knowledge about basic aspects of STEM webcams in the United States (US) from the perspectives of both practitioners and viewers.  Thousands of webcams available to the public are operated by STEM organizations, such as zoos, museums, and government agencies. Learning theory suggests that STEM webcams, especially those with accompanying interpretive tools, have the potential to offer rich informal learning opportunities. However, yet no research has quantified any aspect (cognitive, behavioral, or emotional) of viewer outcomes. This study will be the first to develop baseline data regarding cognitive, behavioral, and emotional aspects of perceived viewer experience. Project activities include  1) An inventory of  STEM webcams that  exist in the US, the STEM disciplines they represent, learning and engagement tools they employ, the number of viewers they reach, and the resources required for their operation; 2) A survey of webcam  operators, their STEM education goals, implementation strategies, and evaluation results; and 3)  Surveys and  interviews gathering data on  viewers demographics and potential  increase in curiosity, interest, knowledge, and behavior toward the STEM subject.  This research will provide foundational knowledge for the STEM-education and research community that quantifies and describes many facets of the population of STEM webcams in the  inventory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Research activities will take place in three distinct phases, with Phase 1 laying the groundwork for Phases 2 and 3.  Phase 1:  The project team will conduct a  systematic internet search  for all identifiable STEM related webcams.   Phase 2 (operator-focused): An online  survey  of practitioners of webcams operated by US-based STEM organizations will be conducted using Qualtrics software.  Likert scales will be used.     Various hypotheses  will be tested regarding webcam program objectives, operations, and evaluations from the perspective of program operators or practitioners. Phase 3 (viewer-focused): Surveys and interviews with likely viewers of STEM webcams. Using the webcam inventory built in Phase 1, the team will collaborate with  20 informal STEM  institutions that agree to survey their constituents to test hypotheses regarding webcam  viewing practices, such as why and how viewers watch, and perceived outcomes of viewing, such as perceived influence on their interest, attitudes, knowledge, or behavior.  The findings from this study will be widely shared with informal STEM institutions and webcam operators.  It will provide foundational data for future experimental studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
