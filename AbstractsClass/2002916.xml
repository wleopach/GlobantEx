<AbstractNarration>The IEEE International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Intelligent Systems and Applications (IEEE 2019), held in Los Angeles, CA, Dec 12-14, 2019, focuses on the issues related to trust, privacy and security and their interplay with artificial intelligence in the context of smart and intelligent systems. It provides an opportunity for researchers to discuss research results at the intersection of artificial intelligence and machine learning with cognitive science and behavioral science and putting human in the loop. Through peer-reviewed technical research papers, invited keynote talks and panel discussions, the conference brings together leaders from interdisciplinary communities to understand the broader set of challenges of and explore holistic solutions for the highly interconnected, AI enhanced digital world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports approximately 15 students to participate in the conference. To facilitate increased level of participation, partial support may be provided to students who have some other means of covering part of their expenses.  Selection criteria include evidence of interest in the field as demonstrated by statement of research interests, CV showing research output, coursework and/or project experience, etc., recommendation letter, and a statement on how participation in the conference would benefit the studentâ€™s research and education. Preference is given to students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
