<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The research aims to understand how organisms respond to changes in their environment. This is important for accurately predicting the effects of a changing climate. This project will investigate how the sea urchin, Diadema antillarum, responds to warming temperatures. These sea urchins play a vital role in Caribbean coral reef ecosystems, which are severely threatened by environmental change. The research will contribute to the management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems that generate essential ecosystem services to people (e.g., fisheries, recreation, tourism, and protection from tropical storms). Additionally, the Fellow will increase the inclusion of underrepresented groups in biology by mentoring students and providing educational outreach activities at institutions that serve historically underrepresented racial minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates the role of epigenetic processes in providing rapid phenotypic plasticity under changing environmental conditions. The project assesses epigenetic patterns and their connection to varying genotypes, demography, and physiological responses (e.g., righting ability), in sea urchins inhabiting areas that naturally differ in their temperature regimes. A reciprocal transplant experiment will be used to distinguish between local adaptation and acclimation processes, followed by spawning and crossing of adult urchins to investigate the persistence of epigenetic marks across generations. Genome-wide differences in DNA methylation, body size, and thermal tolerance will be compared across larvae that differ in their developmental and parental thermal history exposure. The project will also generate a draft genome for Diadema antillarum. The Fellow will mentor students at Florida International University and the University of Puerto Rico. Additionally, the Fellow will provide educational outreach activities to high school students and their families at a South Florida public high school, the Marine Academy of Science and Technology at Florida International Universityâ€™s Biscayne Bay Campus. Public outreach will also be performed in Puerto Rico with the Sociedad Ambiente Marino conservation organization that will include events in which participants actively interact with the study organism to connect its importance to coral reefs and the value that coral reef ecosystems provide to people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
