<AbstractNarration>Clarifying nanoscale interactions in biological matter is arguably one of the most ubiquitous challenges in biology today. The small length scales involved require that quantum effects be taken into account in both modeling and experiments. For example, experimental data suggest that (quantum) vibronic and spin degrees of freedom might underlie a myriad of biologically relevant nanoscale phenomena including: the biosensing of magnetic fields for animal navigation; the regulation of metabolic and physiological function; and the efficiency of electron transport through biomolecules. If this is true, it follows that nanoscale interactions within biological matter could be controlled via quantum-based approaches. In this project, the physiology of cells will be systematically controlled through engineered optical pulses affecting and “driving” different vibronic quantum states inside proteins. Having nanoscale electromagnetic handles onto cellular processes will enable the monitoring and selective stimulation or suppression of cellular and biological functions that are electromagnetic in nature. Controlling nanoscale interactions in biological matter will impact fields as diverse as therapeutics and biomimetic technologies. For example, the course of disease could be altered by controlling quantum-mediated pathways, or by developing drugs that quench or stimulate them; and technological sensors of electromagnetic field could be optimized to rely on quantum rules evolved by nature over the course of millions of years. In addition, the work will open up avenues for interdisciplinary research in chemistry, physics, and biology. Students engaged in this project will benefit from the opportunities to engage with a variety of experimental techniques at the interface of chemistry, biology,  material science and physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments suggest that quantum nanoscale interactions in biological matter might underlie phenomena as varied as magnetic field detection for animal navigation, metabolic and physiological regulation in cells and optimal electron transport in biomolecules. If this is true, it follows that nanoscale interactions within biological matter could be controlled via quantum degrees of freedom. Here, (quantum) vibronic degrees of freedom in proteins will be excited and controlled, with views to systematically assess macroscopic physiological reactions to such quantum stimuli. In a setup that combines confocal microscopy with electrophysiology capabilities, ultrafast optical pulses (femtosecond) will address distinct (quantum) vibronic degrees of freedom in proteins inside cells; cellular physiology will be concomitantly tracked at pertinent timescales (millisecond to second) by the fluorescence of metabolic dyes and by electrophysiological responses. Proteins photoexcited in this way have been demonstrated to influence ion channel functioning and thus macroscale physiology. Importantly, in this project the ultrafast pulses will be numerically engineered to subject particular vibronic pathways to optimal quantum control. Thus, the effect of (fast) engineered nanoscale interactions at the quantum level will be read-out by the effect that they produce on macroscopic biological matter and its (slow) physiological functioning.  A long-term goal is to establish how the photoexcitation of proteins with quantum engineered light pulses translates into repeatable physiological outcomes in cells. This knowledge can be used to drive organismic behavior and physiological function through the control of (quantum) vibronic pathways by tailored light fields. This project will contribute to the training of interdisciplinary researchers working at the interface of chemistry, physics, and biology, and who will be well-versed in a variety of experimental techniques (optics, quantum control, spin physics, cellular biology, nanomaterials development).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
