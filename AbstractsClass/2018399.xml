<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Villanova University is acquiring a triple quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (triple Q-TOF-MS) equipped with a liquid chromatograph to support Professor Anthony Lagalante, Kevin Minbiole, Daniel Kraut, Jacob Elmer and Aimee Eggler and other colleagues. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. In a quadrupole mass spectrometer, there are four cylindrical rods parallel to each other, that serve as the mass analyzer (the component of the instrument responsible for selecting sample ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)). Ions are separated in a quadrupole based on the stability of their trajectories in oscillating electric fields that are applied to the rods. In this instrument, this capability is coupled to a time-of-flight component (TOF) in which the mass-to-charge ratio of an ion is determined by the way in which ions are accelerated by an electric field of known strength. The velocity of the ion depends on the mass-to-charge ratio (heavier ions of the same charge reach lower speeds). The time that the ions take to reach a detector at a known distance is measured. This time depends on the velocity of the ion, and therefore is a measure of its mass-to-charge ratio. From this ratio and known experimental parameters, the ion can be characterized. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students with this modern analytical technique. It is also used in partnerships with nearby primarily undergraduate institutions and a Historically Black College and University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the development of methods of paint pigment analysis for art conservation and authentication and for testing the effectiveness of systemic insecticide imidacloprid and its metabolites on the hemlock woolly adelgid insect pest and the impact of these compounds on native pollinators. The instrumentation is also used for understanding the process of protein degradation and identifying molecular determinants of the proteasome's ability to unfold proteins, and for elucidating host cell response to gene therapy and improving transgene expression by inhibiting or circumventing host cell defenses. In addition, it benefits the development of earthworm hemoglobin as a possible blood substitute and the identification of medicinally-relevant organic small molecules from natural products. The mass spectrometer is also used to characterize the mechanistic and temporal process of the transcriptional activation factor known as Nrf2/ARE (a transcription factor that binds to antioxidant response element and coordinately activates a battery of detoxifying/defensive genes) which protects cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
