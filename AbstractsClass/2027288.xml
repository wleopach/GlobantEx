<AbstractNarration>The spread of antibiotic resistance threatens public health by rendering antibiotics ineffective. Drinking water distribution systems are a source of antibiotic resistance genes, the genetic material that makes bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Water distribution systems are particularly concerning as they are a direct conveyor of antibiotic resistance genes to vulnerable populations including children, the elderly, hospital patients, and people with weakened immune systems. Metals are known to promote the development of antibiotic resistance. Some of these metals are also present in distribution systems due to pipe corrosion and the presence of corrosion inhibitors. The goal of this research is to determine which water pipe materials and corrosion inhibitor choices result in minimal antibiotic resistance. This goal will be achieved through experiments to examine the role of corrosion on antibiotic resistance development. Collaborations between the research team and water utilities will facilitate research to determine the interplay between resistance genes, pipe surfaces, and drinking water chemistry in real-world distribution systems. Further benefits to society will result from guidance provided to drinking water utilities across the country. This guidance will help them decide which pipe materials and corrosion inhibitors best prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance in drinking water to protect public health.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The spread of antibiotic resistance is a primary public health concern. Metals are a known stressor for antibiotic resistance and are prevalent in drinking water systems due to aging infrastructure and the use of metal-containing corrosion inhibitors. The central hypothesis of this work is that corrosion inhibitors and corrosion products yield metals in water distribution systems that increase the abundance and alter the types of antibiotic resistant genes in municipal drinking water.  The research team combines expertise in chemistry and molecular microbiology to address three complimentary objectives. Objective 1 is to determine the impact of corrosion inhibitors on antibiotic resistance under variable nutrient conditions. Objective 2 is to elucidate the effect of corrosion products on antibiotic resistance using complimentary culture-based and non-culture-based techniques. Objective 3 is to identify linkages between corrosion products and the quantity and profile of antibiotic resistance genes in real-world drinking water distribution system pipes. Surface chemistry characterization will be coupled with Droplet Digital PCR to identify chemical relationships to antibiotic resistance gene profiles. Knowledge generated from this research will help utilities mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance in drinking water distribution systems. Results will be incorporated into an annual two-day professional short course on emerging contaminants in water and wastewater. Additionally, the PIs will build on previous summer outreach efforts and host a high school course to engage underrepresented students in summer research to increase the diversity of the Nationâ€™s STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
