<AbstractNarration>High-speed optical core networks have become essential for supporting large-scale data transfers over long distances with low latency and high throughput. In recent years new technologies have emerged that provide for a significant increase in network bandwidth and more flexibility in how that bandwidth is used. For example, the development of Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) has introduced bandwidth-variable switching and dynamic spectrum resizing. Similarly, the paradigm of Space Division Multiplexed (SDM) optical networks has the potential to multiply the line rate of each network link. Even with support from such technologies, the growth of scientific applications and cloud services demands that the technologies be intelligently harnessed to make the most of the bandwidth available. The recipe for success, then, calls for not merely the employment of inherently fast networks with tremendous bandwidth availability, but also smart and efficient resource allocation. This project focuses on that challenge: developing novel flexible resource allocation strategies across multiple resource domains in order to efficiently and successfully provision core networks for future extreme-scale applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project will conduct a comprehensive investigation into the benefits of combining resource assignment flexibility in emerging network technologies. It will establish a baseline against which improvement in flexible allocation algorithms may be developed and evaluated. The specific research objectives of this project are to: &lt;br/&gt;1. Investigate the flexibility enhancements inherent to emerging optical network technologies, such as temporal flexibility, spatial flexibility, and spectral flexibility, and their impact on resource efficiency in Elastic Optical Networks.&lt;br/&gt;2. Extend the flexible resource allocation techniques to next-generation SDM-EON with careful consideration to the additional degree of core flexibility.&lt;br/&gt;3. Investigate coordinated Routing, Modulation, Core, and Spectrum Assignment algorithms that incorporate lightpath switching, lightpath segmentation, and delayed spectrum allocation. &lt;br/&gt;4. Perform an in-depth analysis of the proposed techniques for both EON and SDM-EON architectures in terms of hardware cost-benefit and algorithm complexity.&lt;br/&gt;The project has the potential to have direct impact on research networks supporting the Extreme-Scale Science Community.  Participation of women and URM will be encouraged through the UMass Lowell Urban Massachusetts Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation scholars program and through the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
