<AbstractNarration>This conference will integrate science and engineering experts in order to advance plastic pollution mitigation strategies through interdisciplinary and focused research collaborations. The organizers will address topics such as non-linear effects of micro- and nanoplastic pollution, toxicity in plastic waste, green materials, and environmental and health impacts of the increasingly high concentrations of plastic in the nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing levels of plastic pollution are increasing awareness of and concern for harmful environmental effects of these plastics on ecosystems, living species, and public health. Due to their physical and chemical characteristics, micro- and nanoplastics can be distributed through water where they are ingested by numerous organisms and passed on through the food chain. While the scientific knowledge on these pervasive contaminants is increasing, important uncertainties prevail as plastic continues to be consumed and disposed of at an alarming rate. Sharing research results across national borders and pursuing joint scientific investigations that can shape national strategies is expected to accelerate research in all participating countries and institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Responding to Plastic Pollution Through Science: from Research to Action  Introduction:  With the growing awareness of the scope of plastic pollution in our environment, there has been an increasing interest by decision-makers around the world to engage the scientific community and its expertise to deepen the understanding of the harmful environmental impacts of the plastic fragments on ecosystems, living species and public health. Due to their physical and chemical characteristics, micro- and nanoplastics can be distributed through water and they have been shown to be ingested by numerous organisms. While the scientific knowledge on these emerging contaminants is increasing, important uncertainties prevail. There is a compelling need for sharing research results across the national borders and pursuing joint scientific investigations that can shape national strategies.   Approach:  Under the aegis of the French Embassy in Washington DC, various institutions have connected to organize the first French-US Workshop ?Responding to Plastic Pollution through Science: from research to action? in Le Mans, France, on December 12&amp;13th 2019.  The opening discourse was given by Ang?le Preville, French Senator, member of the parliamentary office for scientific and technological assessment, where she introduced the Research needs for future actions concerning plastic pollution.  During the two days, close to 40 researchers, national agencies representatives and policy makers shared their latest research data and points of view on plastic use, plastic waste mismanagement and consecutive pollution.  The works and debates were divided into four sessions dedicated to:  i) provide a better understanding of the cycle of plastics in the aquatic environment. In this session, the ways of monitoring plastic litter in Europe and US were compared and discussed, showing that global monitoring is necessary to provide a better overview of plastic pollution and predict future trends. The effects of ocean currents on the long-range transport and dispersion of floating debris were shown. Recent data on the contamination in urban and freshwaters together with concentrations in sediments and bivalves from the French coast were presented showing that all these compartments are also polluted by microplastics. Mains sources of plastic pollution were discussed with focus abandoned and lost fishing gear and on tire- wear particles as a major component of microplastics in the aquatic environment.  Finally, the long term fate of plastics in the aquatic environment was discussed through presentations on the mechanisms and kinetics of degradation and fragmentation of plastics depending on their properties under the Influence of water.  ii) reduce plastic littering. Surveys of plastic garbage on remote barrier islands were shown highlighting the necessity to reduce marine litter. After a presentation on the US law and policy regarding plastic waste, discussions have been on plastic research needs and agenda a propel policy. The need for converging on solutions has been arisen, and among solutions, waste valorization through recent perspectives on chemical recycling of plastics has been highlighted for the development of circular economy.  iii) understand the impacts of plastics at all scales. Several recent research works were presented on the toxicity of micro and nanoplastics on several species of the aquatic food web such as plankton, bivalves and fish. Discussions also concerned the methods to evaluate impacts of plastic pollution on species, ecosystems and human health. A focus was made on nanoplastics and the challenges associated to the characterization of their physicochemical behavior and environmental fate. Finally the risk assessment for human health through the presence of microplastics in food was addressed as a gap of knowledge.  iv) determine the major knowledge gaps around plastic pollution and its reduction.  All session contributors worked together to identify a series of information gaps and needs. Among them, several questions involving social sciences were highlighted such as:  -How have production and consumption rates of plastics changed over time in different countries, regions, and communities?  -How can production methods and products be changed to promote chemical and other more effective forms of recycling?  -How can recycling be encouraged now that China is no longer a viable market for used plastics?  -Can we initiate programs that inform better product stewardship and responsibility?   Outcomes:  This catalytic convening between U.S. and French scientists and partner organizations led to several important near and longer-term outcomes. The meeting:  Established a sustained French-American Research Cohort focused on plastic pollution research. Secured a commitment to host a binational workshop in 2021 that will develop a series of science policy briefs as a future outcome. Catalyzed a successful proposal for foundation funding to support a 2020-2021 research project led by the French-American research team focused on tracing the rapid surge of plastic pollution due to Covid-19 (e.g. masks, resurgence of plastic bags, etc.)              Last Modified: 10/30/2020       Submitted by: Erica Goldman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
