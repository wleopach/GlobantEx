<AbstractNarration>This grant requests funding for graduate students attending US Universities to travel to the following research conferences:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-18th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST 2020), February 24-27, 2020, Santa Clara, CA, USA.&lt;br/&gt;-17th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 2020), February 25-27, 2020 in Santa Clara, CA, USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USENIX Association organizes conferences on computing innovation and research that build collaborations between researchers and practitioners from industry, government, and academia. These events provide educational, mentorship, and networking opportunities to graduate students in the computer sciences who attend. The research and computing knowledge shared and advanced at these conferences has practical and meaningful application to many tools used in daily life, as well as to the ethical, cultural, and social ramifications of computing technology. This grant allows the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference, and extends the impact of the research presented to a broad audience of young researchers from across the country. USENIX is an open access organization, and all research and results presented and published at these events are freely available to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support 20 students for the FAST 2020 meeting. FAST is a forum for research in storage systems, bringing together top researchers and practitioners from both industry and academia to explore new directions in the design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of storage systems. The conference will consist of two and a half days of technical presentations, including refereed papers, Work-in-Progress reports, and two poster sessions. There will also be training sessions offered on the days prior to the technical sessions. FAST has been taking place annually since 2008, and bi-annually prior to that. This grant will support 20 students for the NSDI 2020 meeting. NSDI focuses on the design principles and challenges in the construction of large-scale networks and distributed systems. Particular areas of interest include cloud services, wireless, internet routing, peer-to-peer systems, sensor nets, scalable web services, data center networking, distributed malware, and distributed network measurement. NSDI unites researchers from across the networking and systems community—including computer networking, distributed systems, and operating systems—to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
