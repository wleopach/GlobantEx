<AbstractNarration>This award supports students at US institutions to attend the Twenty-first Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile). The HotMobile workshop will be held in Austin, TX, March 3-4, 2020.  HotMobile is a workshop targeting mobile computing and system integration fields. Attending this event will benefit the scientific progress of a student's research. The workshop discusses fundamental open questions, advocates new approaches, offers constructive critiques of the state-of-the-art, debunks existing assumptions, reports unexpected early results, reports on promising but unproven ideas, or proposes new evaluation methods. The exposure to the technical content of HotMobile will inspire students to address the tough problems in their respective fields, with a long-term benefit of scientific advances in mobile computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Priority will be given to students who will benefit from attending this workshop but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel funding. In addition, applications from female and underrepresented groups in mobile computing research will be strongly encouraged. Up to 25 students will receive travel grants from this award to attend HotMobile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
