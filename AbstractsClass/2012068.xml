<AbstractNarration>This project addresses a set of open fundamental problems at the intersection of atomic, particle physics, and cosmology. The PI plans to set up a program to search for new light particles and forces. The research will provide theoretical results that are necessary to take full advantage of the rapid progress in tabletop precision atomic physics experiments that can then act as a new frontier in searches for new physics. Any such discovery of new physics will revolutionize the field of particle physics and, if the new particle is the dark matter, potentially also our understanding of the Universe. The goals of this project are to spearhead a new generation of atomic precision measurements aimed at searches for physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles and interactions, with a particular focus on novel atomic clocks with high sensitivity to new physics effects and dark matter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PI will (1) develop atomic theory needed for new generation of new physics searches with precision atomic measurements; (2) develop theoretical tools for the interpretation of experimental results, dearly needed to be able to take full advantage of the innovative concepts for new physics searches via ultra-accurate measurements; and (3) investigate specific dark matter scenarios that can be probed with atomic clocks. Atomic theory development in this project focuses on methods to treat two types of very different problems: (1) cases where none of the precision methods work at all, and theory cannot provide reliable estimates (2) cases where exceptional sub-percent precision is required, and even most accurate present methods are inadequate. For the first problem, the team will build upon the fast parallel configuration interaction (CI) code that was recently developed and develop algorithms for efficient selection of the configuration functions that need to be included for reliable predictions at the 10% level. For the second problem, the team will expand the inclusion of the electronic correlations in the hybrid method that combines CI and coupled-cluster approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
