<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest in excellent undergraduate education by helping students better understand processes involving biological molecules.  Biology textbooks and teaching materials use two-dimensional static images to show complex three-dimensional molecules and molecular events that occur over time.  As a result, students often need help to understand these processes, such as protein folding, protein-protein interactions, and DNA replication, and RNA transcription.  These processes occur on a scale that is starkly different from everyday human experience, making understanding them even more challenging.  This project intends to use networked augmented reality (AR) technology to make molecules and their interactions visible to students on a human scale.  AR technology will also allow multiple users to control 3D representations of molecules, enabing students work together as a group to learn about molecules and their interactions.  The project intends to examine how the AR experience alters students’ understanding of molecules and processes at the molecular level, as well as test whether student learning is improved by social interactions in a networked augmented reality environment.  Once the materials and software developed by the project are ready for classroom use, they will be made freely available via Creative Commons licensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to advance STEM education by developing intuitive ways for students to engage with molecular-scale phenomena. To do so, the project will harness AR as a tool to bring molecular phenomena to life and to present them in a social context that promotes active engagement and long-term learning.  Networked AR headsets will allow multiple users to view and control a shared 3D simulation from multiple points of view, and pass-through visualization will create a safe and naturally socially mediated AR environment.  Each student in a group will have a unique role and individualized access to relevant information, ensuring a collaborative student-led effort to develop their conceptual and quantitative understanding of molecular phenomena as they explore a series of lessons and challenges.  The 3D simulations will react in real time to student control of relevant parameters and will include continuously updating graphs and other mathematical representations.  The research goal of this project is to investigate best practices for incorporating head-mounted AR technology in STEM education by testing the effects of two teaching strategies: student engagement in collaborative social interactions and engagement with 3D instruction environments.  Project success will be measured by quantitative assessment of four learning outcomes: accuracy of factual understanding; use of expert language; fluency of quantitative reasoning; and tendency to communicate complex spatial relationships using 3D examples or analogies.  The long-term goal of the research is to create freely available socially mediated AR instructional resources that deepen students’ understanding of molecular-scale phenomena and quantitative relationships that are integral to STEM courses across all grade levels.  Through networked interactions within these interactive environments, socially mediated AR has the potential to increase equitable access to STEM learning, by providing educational opportunities for students across rural regions and in other situations that creaet accessibility challenges.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
