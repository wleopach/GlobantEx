<AbstractNarration>The University of Central Floridaâ€™s Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site is aimed at fostering multidisciplinary engineering research towards developing new materials and devices for application in biotechnology and medicine. Medical technology keeps advancing, often at a disruptive pace to keep up with the existing and new needs of the population. Monitoring human health, improved diagnostics, improvement of quality of life during and after illness, and treatment and prevention of current and newly developing diseases are driving demand for better tools and therapies. This is an emerging market with large demand for trained personnel as research findings continue to move from laboratory to the field. This REU site brings together engineering, computer science, photonics research, chemistry and biochemistry, and nanoscience and technology fields in multidisciplinary teams focused around these areas. Experiences for the REU participants include research projects in topics such as remote monitoring of physiological parameters using implantable sensors, as early as possible disease detection using biomarkers, and smart therapeutic tools. This program also includes enrichment activities including professional development opportunities to build skill sets relevant to research and to professional life. Social activities will facilitate developing bonds and networking at the REU site, industry site visits, and a research showcase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Central Florida is a Hispanic Serving Institution. This REU site has a strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion to broaden participation by students from underrepresented groups and by students from colleges with limited research opportunities and primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) in STEM research activities. 3D microelectrode in vitro chips, electronic biosensors, wound healing patches, on-chip plasmonic biosensors, and software engineering for study of biomolecule-substrate interactions and for reduction of vertebrate animal testing are cutting edge examples of research at the REU site. The research is hypothesis based and REU participants are mentored to independence and hypothesis formulating skills, while developing hands-on expertise with research methods, tools, analysis and dissemination of their work. This REU site engages participants 10 weeks per year, and we emphasize broader impacts on students from traditionally underrepresented groups in engineering, and on students from colleges with limited research opportunities and primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI). In addition to research, students are also made aware of the role of engineering in biomedical technology and medicine, receive training in responsible conduct of research, and develop communication skills of students in interdisciplinary environment, through research, our writing program and community outreach. REU participants represent a new generation of future engineers and scientists that will lead the way in the development of advanced materials and technologies for application in biotechnology and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
