<AbstractNarration>Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) “Enzymes, Coenzymes and Metabolic Pathways” seminar will be held on July 25th–26th, 2020, at the Waterville Valley Resort in Waterville Valley, NH. This is a pivotal conference for early-career researchers focused on the study of biochemistry, engineering, physics, and chemistry, who are interested in dissecting the molecular mechanisms of biochemical reactions to share ideas and network in an informal setting. The long-term goals of this seminar are to foster interactions and collaborations among the graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who share common research interests – studying the roles of enzymes in the biological processes that are fundamental for life. To achieve these goals, the GRS has created a program of 13 Speakers (12 chosen from abstracts submitted by attendees, and an established investigator as a Keynote Speaker). These talks will describe current advances in methodology, the discovery and characterization of enzymes, engineering these systems for industrial applications, and the relation of these enzymes to disease processes and the environment.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The GRS will hold a Career Mentorship Panel (5 leaders from diverse backgrounds), to expose the trainees to different career options as scientists in the field of enzyme research. This career panel will help graduate students and postdoctoral researchers decide between different paths and to network with the panelists in the various careers represented in the session. The seminar includes two poster sessions where all attendees can present their work to their peers and the panelists. These poster sessions will provide a unique opportunity for junior scientists to mingle and interact with senior investigators. This meeting was supported by the Molecular Biophysics program in the Division of Molecular and cellular Biosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
