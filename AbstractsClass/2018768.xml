<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a high-resolution, four-dimensional (4D) X-Ray Computed Tomography (XCT) system to enable a broad range of fundamental materials research. The knowledge gained will enable advances in the design of novel and high-performance materials ? leading to smart and more resilient structures, better medical treatments, and to enhanced energy efficiency. The XCT system will also support education, training, and outreach activities at Missouri S&amp;T and partner institutions, including historically black Lincoln University and Tuskegee University. These activities include training of K-12 students and teachers, integration of the instrumentation into courses and interdisciplinary training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, including individuals from underrepresented minorities at the partner institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features of a material?s microstructure dictate its performance (e.g., mechanical and transport properties). Any external or internal stimulus that imparts changes to microstructure of a material ? for example, mechanical load, or chemical reaction ? invariably causes its properties to change. Knowledge of such intrinsic microstructure-property links in materials can reveal the origins of the materials? physicochemical behavior, which can subsequently be capitalized on to optimize their performance. The XCT system ? owing to its ability to perform in-situ, real-time characterization of 3D microstructure of materials of various types ? will advance research in many areas relevant to design of new materials (e.g., novel cementitious materials; and shape memory alloys), and optimization of performance of prevailing materials (e.g., glasses and ceramics; biomaterials for tissue repair; digitally-fabricated materials; and energy storage-and-conversion materials). With such capabilities, the XCT system will empower the pursuit of high-risk-high-reward research ? for instance, to study how mechanical/thermal loads or undesired reactions lead to initiation and propagation of microcracks in a heterogeneous porous material, and to what extent the cracks will affect the material?s transport properties. Significantly, the XCT system will facilitate research geared towards revealing microstructure-property links, and bridging fundamental knowledge-gaps in: characterizing the early stage reactions and microstructure developments in novel CO2-efficient cementitious binders;  modeling the development of porosity, lack of fusion, and other defects in additively-manufactured metallic parts; fabricating bespoke components of nickel-titanium shape memory alloys for stiffness-matched biomedical applications, precision force actuators, and energy absorbers; elucidating the deteriorative reactions and transport phenomena in nuclear waste glass surface alteration layer; developing oxygen reactive polymer nanoparticle-based therapeutics to treat traumatic brain injury; and revealing the fundamental relationship between 3D internal microstructural network (with sub-micron resolution) of lithium-ion battery electrodes and the transport of ions and electrons, and correspondingly the battery?s performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
