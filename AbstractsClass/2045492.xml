<AbstractNarration>Women of color (e.g. African American, Hispanic, and Native American) remain largely underrepresented in computing degree programs and careers. Sociocultural barriers are significant contributors to the stratification of participation in computing along racialized, gendered, and classed lines. However, focusing solely on long-standing sociocultural barriers can have the unintended consequence of perpetuating deficit narratives and further preventing girls of color from envisioning themselves as active participants in computing. This study challenges deficit narratives through an investigation of how a computational justice program model can support girls of color (ages 13-16) in developing agentic computing identities. An agentic computing identity describes the ability to view oneself as an active participant in computing with the knowledge and skills to enact social change and control future life trajectories. A computational justice approach develops concrete computing skills and simultaneously provides opportunities for girls of color to ground those skills in self-directed forms of personal and collective action. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research makes intellectual contributions to K-12 computer science education and design-based research through: (1) an empirical understanding of how girls of color develop computing identities, (2) a broadened conceptual understanding of computing identities that incorporates agency as a core construct, (3) an empirical understanding of how investigating the relationship between computing and social change influences feelings of self-efficacy, competency, recognition, interest, and agency among girls of color, (4) a theoretical examination of how concepts from social science disciplines (social change, collective action, agency) can inform K-12 CS education efforts, and (5) a novel co-design process that leverages cooperative partnerships for sustained adoption of informal computing programs.  This research will create a robust computing identity model that moves beyond performance-based identity models and can theoretically inform educational interventions aimed at broadening participation in computing. It will also contribute a program model that includes an asset-based pedagogical approach, justice-centered curricular design, and practitioner-informed training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
