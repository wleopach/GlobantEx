<AbstractNarration>As technology advances and more industries begin to embrace automation, there is a national need for more automation technicians.  These technicians must have broad skills in areas including programming, robotics, automation, and control.  North Dakota recognizes the need to diversify its industry base and provide training so its citizens can fill jobs in advanced manufacturing.  This training is urgently needed to enable the state to stay ahead of the anticipated decrease in energy-focused sectors.  Unfortunately, automation and manufacturing technician training in North Dakota is limited.  This project aims to help fill this need by expanding access to automation and manufacturing technology, especially in the rural areas served by Bismarck State College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, Bismarck State College will expand on existing foundational courses to create an Associate of Applied Sciences degree in Automation and Manufacturing Technology. New automation equipment will be purchased, and faculty will develop high quality hands-on activities that enable students to gain the knowledge and skills needed to use the equipment effectively. The degree program will include multiple entry points, thus serving students at different career stages. Advisers serving as Career Navigators will receive training to help them place graduates in manufacturing plants, processing plants, and other places that use automation. Materials for recruiting students into the degree program will be created by adapting case studies from the National Institute for Women in Trades, Technology and Sciences. The college’s existing Industry Advisory Committee will be expanded to include relevant industries in developing the content of the degree program's stackable certificates, thus building on Bismarck State College’s strong history of creating technical programs to meet local industry needs. The evaluation of this project can inform industry and education stakeholders about how to to decrease the time and expense needed to deploy a new degree by effectively modifying and expanding an existing foundation.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
