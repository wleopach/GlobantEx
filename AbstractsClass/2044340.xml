<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is the development of the modular joint technology for the construction of resilient bridges with enhanced public safety, reduced cost and time for construction, and improved lifespan. The modular joint technology has the potential to replace ageing infrastructure and to reconstruct bridges damaged by disasters, with a focus on 100-400 ft. bridges. Of the 67,824 existing 100-400 ft. span bridges in the U.S., 23% are structurally deficient or beyond the typical design life. Further, disasters often destroy bridges, preventing effective evacuation efforts and leaving displaced populations without access to food, water, or medical aid. To reduce mortality and morbidity rates following disasters and to expedite economic recovery, there is an urgent need to reconstruct damaged bridges. In addition to addressing these needs, this project will support the education of two graduate students in entrepreneurship and innovation, including research and coursework leading to graduate degrees in Civil Engineering, coursework in entrepreneurship leading to a Certificate, participation in I-Corps, and internships. Broadening participation of underrepresented groups will be achieved through research opportunities and an annual, “INVITE: InNoVatIon, Technology, and business in Engineering” workshop for undergraduate students from multiple institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance the modular joint technology for commercialization. The modular joint technology is a paradigm change in design: the connection is the module and the members are standard steel sections. The technology harnesses the benefits of modularity (cost/time savings through mass-production) and trusses (high efficiency, ease of design, longevity), while overcoming the deficiencies of existing modular bridges (limited spans, unreliable pin connections) and conventional trusses (high fabrication cost, difficult construction, lack of safety). Specifically, the modular joint is comprised of a weldment/built-up section of webs and flanges that includes a starter segment to connect to members or other modular joints. Flanges and webs are connected independently through bolted splice connections, forming a moment-resisting connection that provides the potential for the structure to tolerate member loss. The proposed translational research will address the remaining technical challenges for commercialization: fabrication, construction, and safety. Research objectives include: (1) identifying parameters for minimum fabrication cost while meeting structural performance criteria, (2) investigating construction procedures and fit-up strategies, (3) evaluating behavior under member loss and fatigue load cases, and (4) developing design details and guidelines. Research will be performed through rigorous numerical investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
