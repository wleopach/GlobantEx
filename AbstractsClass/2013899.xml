<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commerical potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a potentially significant reduction in medication-related falls, injuries, and deaths, as well as a reduction in fall-related medical costs.  The number of older adults dying from falls increased by a factor of three between 2000 and 2016, with increased medication use possibly contributing to this alarming trend.   Polypharmacy (i.e., taking 4 or more drugs) is growing with a 3-fold increase from 1992 to 2002.  Since drugs are a modifiable risk factor, periodic medication reviews are recommended for fall prevention.   This project will explore a new balance test involving target tracking to remotely monitor medication fall risk and allowing for timelier, personalized assessment of the risk of getting hurt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new balance test using target tracking. Technical work includes: 1) Confirm that the new test is sensitive to medication effects and is safe to perform; 2) Discriminate between fallers and non-fallers, thus demonstrating test validity; and 3) Compare test results with those of other tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
