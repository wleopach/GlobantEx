<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of New Orleans is acquiring an inductively coupled, triple quadrupole, mass spectrometer (ICP-triple Q-MS) with laser ablation capabilities to support the research programs of Professor Phoebe Zito and colleagues Matthew Tarr, David Podgorski, Viktor Poltavets and Robert Mahon. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. An ICP-MS combines a high-temperature and an ionization coupled plasma source with a mass spectrometer. The ICP source converts the atoms of the elements in the sample to ions. These ions are subsequently separated and detected by the mass spectrometer. This is a highly-sensitive analytical technique capable of measuring very low concentrations of metals and non-metals in liquid samples. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students with this modern analytical technique. It is also used in outreach activities involving students and faculty from Louisiana State University, Southeastern Louisiana University, the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, the University of Alaska-Anchorage, Southwest Engineers and other area institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the identification of isotopic compositions to improve the geologic record and the analyzes of clay sources for pottery in the archaeology field. The instrumentation is also used for detecting synergistic effects of nanoparticles in the environment and for identifying metals and their concentrations from natural and human impacted aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, it contributes to the determination of calcium rich deposits in fishes, shelled invertebrates, and coralline algae and the measurement of contaminants in fishes, and organisms at the base of food webs with trace elements such as arsenic and cadmium. The mass spectrometer is also used to search for innovative approaches and alternatives for renewable/rechargeable batteries with industrial partners. The ICP spectrometer is also employed for analyses of trace elements bound to organic matter and other petroleum complexes altering toxicity, biotic and abiotic reactivity, and contamination in aquatic water bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
