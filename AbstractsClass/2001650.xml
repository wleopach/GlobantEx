<AbstractNarration>Optical tweezers won the 2018 Nobel Prize in physics for their applications in biological systems. The tweezers use a highly focused laser beam to trap and manipulate small objects, including cells, particles, bacteria, and virus. Despite the huge success of optical tweezers, the requirement of sophisticated optical setups and high working power prevent their non-invasive manipulation of fragile objects. Tremendous efforts have been made to develop new techniques for optical trapping. However, a universal strategy to safely manipulate different particles and cells in various liquid environments is still elusive. This proposal aims to develop a new optical tweezing platform based on laser cooling and thermal migration of particles in a temperature gradient. Laser cooling can create a localized cold spot on a substrate where various particles can be trapped by thermophoresis. The cooling-induced trapping is expected to effectively avoid the thermal damages due to optical heating in conventional optical tweezer, and the general thermophoretic migration behavior allows this strategy to be used for a wide range of biological cells and nanoparticles to advance life sciences and biomedical applications, including tissue engineering, cellular biology, early disease diagnosis, and drug delivery. The proposed research at the interfaces of physics, photonics, thermo-fluidics, colloidal sciences, and biology will provide interdisciplinary research opportunities for graduate students, undergraduate students, and K-12 students. The outreach efforts will be integrated into two existing Women in Engineering Program initiatives on campus to increase recruiting women and underrepresented minorities into engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opto-thermophoretic tweezers were recently developed as an alternative strategy to manipulate particles and cells in a light-controlled temperature gradient with simple optics and low operation power. However, the current laser-heating-based opto-thermophoretic tweezers suffer from limited applicability to special solvent conditions and potential optothermal damages. The objective of this proposal is to develop and apply new opto-thermophoretic tweezers based on laser cooling of the substrates. Due to the common thermophobia in colloidal species, a variety of biological cells and particles can be trapped at the laser beams via thermophoresis in their native environments. In addition, this design can avoid thermal damages due to the temperature increase in optical tweezers and the heating-based opto-thermophoretic tweezers. The proposed research will provide a novel platform for versatile and non-invasive optical manipulation for nanoparticles and biological cells. The intellectual merit is that the proposed research will improve fundamental understanding of laser cooling and thermophoresis, establish safe optical manipulation techniques for cells in biological media, and advance biological applications of optical tweezers, including studies of cell-cell interactions and thermal cues in cellular behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
