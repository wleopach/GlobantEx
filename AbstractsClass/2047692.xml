<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program will explore topology optimization (i.e., finding the optimal shape of a structure for given design criteria) to create and enable next-generation large-scale civil structures with a variety of unique and tunable multi-functionalities. The next-generation civil structures envisioned in this research do not only improve built environment in normal conditions, but also actively respond to hazardous conditions to better respond to them. Structures, such as beams, columns, and panels, will be created with optimized shapes and material constitutions, embedded with stimuli-responsive materials, to unlock unconventional responses and adaptability. This research will result in fundamental improvements for risk mitigation and multi-functionality of civil structures. The knowledge created will also allow advancement in other fields, such as aerospace structures, architected materials, and metamaterials. An education and outreach program that centers around structural design optimization will be executed with the philosophy of active, interactive, and immersive learning. The activities include creating immersive education tools, active learning-based outreach to K-12 and underrepresented groups, multidisciplinary course development, and enhancement of academia/industry interactions through collaborations with practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goal of this research is to create multi-functional civil structures and components, with sufficient load-bearing capacity and efficient material usage. The multi-functionality includes a variety of unconventional load-displacement responses and the ability to tune and adapt structural properties via magnetic actuation through a unique multi-material and multi-physics topology optimization approach. The research objectives are to: (1) establish an integrated structural framework that considers geometry, multiple materials, and complex multi-physics interactions; (2) formulate an optimization-based theory to program the structural responses and adaptability subjected to mechanical load and multi-physical stimuli; (3) create optimized structures with multiple functions; and (4) prototype and test structures with programmed responses and adaptability, and explore practical issues to calibrate the theory. The overarching theme of this research is to harness structures made of multiple materials to enlarge the design space and exploit multi-physics interactions to enable adaptability with minimal effort. This project will advance the field of multi-functional civil engineering structures and opens up the possibility for a broad range of applications that can transform how such structures are designed and constructed, and make them more efficient, resilient, and sustainable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
