<AbstractNarration>The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program.  Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research. This planning grant will develop well-formulated plans for a future Engineering Research Center for In-Situ Control of the Nitrogen Cycle.  The program combines expertise in engineering, chemistry, data science and analytics, environmental science, and social and policy science, and establishes a flexible and robust process to identify and engage stakeholders. These stakeholders span academia, industry, and government, and will collaborate in the planning grant to define convergent research themes within four primary thrusts: (1) distributed fertilizer manufacturing, (2) efficient and controlled application of nitrogen fertilizer, (3) fertilizer recycling, and (4) nitrogen cycles as social-ecological systems. Development within these themes provides a platform for a sustainable "closed loop approach" for 21st century food supply, where nitrogenous fertilizers are efficiently produced, applied, and recycled at or near the site of application. Information gathered from the core team and stakeholders during the initial stages of the planning process will be developed into a formal set of technical goals within each of the four thrust areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to advance knowledge in the distributed small-scale ammonia production, the availability of nitrogen flow and application models, knowledge of soil and water chemistry and nitrogen-based environmental effects, and achieving a heightened understanding of the interface of technologies with socio-ecological systems. The proposed program establishes the necessary convergence approach required to address these challenges, while narrowing focus to challenges related to fertilizer inefficiencies, and to engineering-based approaches and adoption. The program brings broad expertise, including expertise required to link technology efforts with societal impact, establishes convergence research themes, and develops metrics appropriate for measuring progress towards these themes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over-production and application of nitrogen fertilizer in the developed world is responsible for a broad range of deleterious environmental effects, even while agriculture in the developing world suffers from a lack of bioavailable nitrogen. The planning grant catalyzes a process to solve challenges related to fertilizer production, application, and recycling, with additional focus on the regulatory and economic factors that ultimately connect engineering innovation with societal impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We successfully complete a planning grant to explore a convergence approach to a complete and sustainable ?closed loop? for 21stcentury food supply, where nitrogenous fertilizers are efficiently produced, applied, and recycled at or near the site of application, In-Situ Control of the Nitrogen Cycle (In-SINC).  The project was led by Texas Tech University (TTU) in collaboration with partner universities: Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), and Florida A&amp;M University (FAMU).   The planning grant for In-SINC enabled the identification and engagement of the communities essential to a convergence approach to solving challenges associated with efficient fertilizer production and use.   The award successfully concluded with the workshop, Onsite Fertilizer Production &amp; the Future of Agriculture, held via videoconference in Lubbock, TX on 28-29 July 2020.  The goals of the workshop were to identify the gaps, barriers and opportunities to establish a research and development roadmap leading to a sustainable, secure, and transformational agrochemical industry.  Attended by more than 70 leading researchers (from academia, industry, government, and private non-profit laboratories), students, and government officials, the workshop was designed specifically to encourage open discussion about in-situ control of the nitrogen cycle, onsite fertilizer production and the future of agriculture.  Researchers across a variety of disciplines -- including agricultural sciences, data science, engineering, plant and soil sciences -- participated. Disciplinary leads provided formal presentations that represented perspectives from industry, agriculture, geosciences, engineering, and analytical chemistry. Three subgroups then assessed the state-of-the art, and considered open questions around specific convergent research themes:  Fertilizer application and management; Precision agriculture, sensors, and data analytics; and Sustainable fertilizer production.   Discussions following these groups? deliberations led to goals for near- and longer-term actions.  Key goals call for research to:   1.     Improve application of nutrients to increase nutrient use efficiency;   2.     Increase capture of excess nutrients from agricultural fields;   3.     Quantify societal benefits of decreases in N loss, for example, through water quality improvement, and increases in profits from impacted industries, such as fisheries;   4.     Develop biodegradable, disposable, low-cost nitrate sensors for soil measurements;   5.     Develop wireless interrogated low-cost multiple resonators using dielectric material and printable, passive sensors and defining trade-off between range and self-powered operation;   6.     Integrate Landsat data and farm tractor based optical sensor data;   7.     Apply AI and machine learning methodologies for fertilizer and carbon sequestration in one model, including crop yield   8.     Actively recruit students into this cross-disciplinary field of study for an exciting career which includes sensor engineering, data analytics and agricultural sciences;   9.     Develop small-scale and mid-scale methods which can reduce carbon intensity of ammonia synthesis by half, with a 10-year goal of developing zero-carbon methods; and   10.  Guide and/or enact policy changes to improve nitrogen management.       Last Modified: 09/28/2020       Submitted by: Gerardine G Botte]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
