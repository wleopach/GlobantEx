<AbstractNarration>There will always be limitations on human ability to collect and process data&lt;br/&gt;about systems, environments, and populations.  Algorithmic agents act in real&lt;br/&gt;time based on partial, noisy information about the world, and the elimination&lt;br/&gt;of uncertainty through "learning" must often be balanced against the&lt;br/&gt;optimization of some objective.  The cost of choices made in the present must&lt;br/&gt;be weighed against the risk that those choices might incur further costs in&lt;br/&gt;the future.  Information theory provides a rich and fertile framework for quantifying and&lt;br/&gt;managing uncertainty.  The situation becomes more subtle when distinct pieces&lt;br/&gt;of information carry differing costs. Consider one's 401(k) balance at&lt;br/&gt;retirement.  While the least significant digit is most uncertain, there is&lt;br/&gt;substantially more cost associated with incorrectly predicting the value of the&lt;br/&gt;most significant digit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns probability spaces endowed with a metric that describes&lt;br/&gt;the associated cost of uncertainty.  Designing algorithms to optimize in such a&lt;br/&gt;framework is intimately connected to having a robust theory of metric&lt;br/&gt;information.  Moreover, the settings of online optimization and competitive&lt;br/&gt;analysis provide a deep and varied set of formal models in which to apply these&lt;br/&gt;methods and test their efficacy.  In an area where algorithm design and &lt;br/&gt;analysis have often been seen as ad-hoc and unstructured, the framework &lt;br/&gt;underlying this work contends that both algorithms and their analysis can be&lt;br/&gt;derived readily from the right set of underlying definitions.  Indeed, many &lt;br/&gt;problems in this area have been researched for 30-40 years, and&lt;br/&gt;yet preliminary application of algorithms and analysis tools from online convex&lt;br/&gt;optimization--in the context of metric probability spaces--has already achieved&lt;br/&gt;a sequence of breakthroughs.  The team of researchers will develop the &lt;br/&gt;corresponding theory, guided by a collection of prominent open problems, with&lt;br/&gt;the ultimate goal of understanding in what circumstances, and to what extent, &lt;br/&gt;one can limit the detrimental effects of uncertainty on optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
