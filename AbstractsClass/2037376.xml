<AbstractNarration>This project funds the inaugural meeting of a new national research organization ,the Atlanta Network for Race, Ethnicity, and Politics (ANREP), comprised of political and social scientists living in and/or studying issues related to racial politics affecting the Southeastern United States. The purpose of this first meeting is to for attendees to critically evaluate workshop papers addressing theoretically-motivated research questions about the 2020 U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections and to provide professional development support to help attendees ultimately publish their papers. In addition, discussion will focus on institutionalizing the organizational framework and plans for the group.   The conference goals align with NSFâ€™s mission to help advance the progress of science and the goal of diversifying the STEM community as it supports research on and by Americans who come from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference and network brings together scholars from Atlanta-area minority serving institutions, including historically Black colleges and minority-serving universities, with faculty from non-MSI research universities, to enhance scholarship, training, and career development in the study of race, ethnicity, and politics. The conference, held at Clark Atlanta University and Emory University in June 2021, uses the 2020 U.S. elections as substantive foci, the conference highlights research on and by African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans. After a national call for papers, the proposed conference showcases 12 papers in four substantive panels, as well as a professional development panel on publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
