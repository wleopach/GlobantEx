<AbstractNarration>CARTA (Center for Accelerated Real-time Analytics) is a multi-university Industry-University Cooperative Research Center that started in 2018. As more devices are deployed that produce real-time data, technologies beyond simply storing and archiving future use data are in demand. CARTA aims at developing such techniques by exploiting artificial intelligence and machine learning, which would make an impact on a wide range of areas, including science, engineering, medicine, marketing, and finances. University of Miami will join CARTA as a new partner site (called “CARTA Miami”), support the mission of CARTA, and expand the scope of research of CARTA.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The real-time analytics research at CARTA Miami will be focused on neuroscience, signal processing, IoT, genetics, UAVs, and marketing. Initial research projects will focus on a) using real-time EEG feedback from portable EEG systems to produce music recommendations for controlling mood, b) combining real-time audio and video captured with UAVs to detect anomaly, c) adding genetic information to real-time product recommendation, d) delivering real-time recommendations to shoppers, and e) collecting IoT signals in smart homes to make real-time decisions. CARTA Miami will leverage the high-performance computing available at the Institute for Data Science and Computing at the University.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;CARTA Miami will offer a unique opportunity for graduate students to improve their research and communication skills. They will participate in collaborative research with industrial partners. The experience will teach the graduate students how to succeed in industrial R&amp;D, which is essential for their careers. Furthermore, the industrial partners can expand their research portfolio by exploring new ideas at CARTA. Because CARTA is a multi-site center, sharing of information across sites can bring additional benefits to both its partners and students. The site will communicate its activities through research publications, conference presentations, and reports.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;At all partner sites of CARTA, the private industry partner data is kept confidential. CARTA has a center-wide 6-month embargo policy. CARTA Miami follows this Center-wide policy. Under the policy, publicly-available data generated at CARTA Miami will be made available after a 6-month embargo through the University of Miami’s data repository. Interested researchers, both CARTA members and non-CARTA members, may request copies of data stored in the repository via email.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
