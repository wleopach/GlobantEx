<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging programs. Professors Garry Grubbs II and Kristen Donnell of Missouri S&amp;T, along with collaborators Stephen Cooke of SUNY-Purchase, Paul Raston of James Madison University, and Galen Sedo of the University of Virginia?s College at Wise, are developing a state-of-the-art Chirped Pulse Fourier Transform Microwave (CP-FTMW) spectrometer. This instrument is utilized in the collection of rotational spectra for gas phase molecules. Rotational spectra provide some of the most detailed information available about the structure of molecules. This multi-user spectrometer offers a significant increase in sensitivity and sourcing capabilities for research in a variety of fundamental gas phase physical chemistry and chemical physics fields. Moreover, this instrument promotes discovery and the progress of science in the areas of laboratory measurements of interstellar detection, experimental benchmarking for newly synthesized materials, gas phase molecular interactions, absolute molecular structure determinations inclusive of chirality, and actinide-element chemistry, among others. The development of the instrument also establishes a pipeline program for chemistry students of the primarily undergraduate and Hispanic Serving Institution, University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley, to apply for the Missouri S&amp;T Chemistry PhD program, thereby supporting diversity in the sciences. In addition, this award supports training for undergraduate students and graduate students from underrepresented groups, and facilitates training and mentorship for postdoctoral fellows. The postdocs and student researchers have frequent opportunities to interact with senior researchers and other students in chemistry and physics, providing both networking opportunities and an enriched learning environment for next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new, state-of-the-art instrument for gas phase molecular structure rotational spectroscopy measurements is being developed. This instrument possesses both Chirped Pulse Fourier Transform Microwave (CP-FTMW, relative structure for bond lengths and angles) and microwave three-wave mixing (M3WM, absolute structure for chirality) capabilities. The instrument implements a state-of-the-art approach of multiple-antennae detection, along with multiple sample introduction nozzles, to increase instrument sensitivity. The nozzles are supersonic molecular beam sampling systems that possess heated laser ablation capabilities, and direct current discharge capability for the investigation of many chemical problems associated with exotic/unstable or nonvolatile species. The degree of system improvement particularly of the novel multiple-antennae detection approach is being studied and quantified as part of this research. The scientific advancements offered by the new instrument enable research from a group of users known as the Midwest Microwave Consortium (MWMC) - a group of nine mostly primarily undergraduate universities that share time on and participate in the development of the instrument. The final, commissioned instrument features remote access, control, and scheduling through a website, allowing both national and international scientific community access throughout its lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
