<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by improving the preparation of biomedical engineers.  It intends to do so by developing an interdisciplinary team learning framework for biomedical innovation in undergraduate education.  In this framework, engineering students at Texas Tech University will engage in biomedical research and innovation through collaboration with medical students at Texas Tech University Health Science Center and entrepreneurship mentors at Texas Tech University Innovation Hub. Solutions to today?s complex medical problems require collaboration between engineers, scientists, and healthcare professionals.  Unfortunately, few college campuses provide structured opportunities for such interdisciplinary collaboration. The project's novel concept is to create a one-year cross-institutional course focused on solving commonly encountered clinical problems. Through this work, student teams will develop biomedical products that might be commercialized for the health care market. The project will benefit society by arming young people with practical STEM knowledge, tools for innovation, and teamwork skills to address critical health care problems. The project may be scalable into a nation-wide program that will promote strong linkages between STEM education and biomedical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project intends to generate new knowledge about the impact of collaborations between medical students and undergraduate engineering students on the undergraduate students? learning outcomes, creativity, and entrepreneurship. The project core is development of an interdisciplinary learning environment in which undergraduate students and medical students collaborate on research projects mentored by professionals from academia, health clinics, and industry. Implementation of the course will include flipped classroom pedagogy combined with project-based learning. The work is undergirded by constructivist learning theory and includes evaluation of both cognitive and non-cognitive impacts on students through pre- and post-semester surveys, using appropriate survey instruments. Impact on faculty will also be investigated. The learning environment is expected to be an incubator for skill-based research training as well as entrepreneurship in biomedical innovation. A cross-institutional faculty consultant team will provide knowledge and skill scaffolding, as well as offer frequently encountered clinical challenges that might be topics for innovative solutions. As part of the course, venture investors, technology experts, and serial entrepreneurs will share their insights and experiences in launching successful projects.  This project is funded by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources program, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
