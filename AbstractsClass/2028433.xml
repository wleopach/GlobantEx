<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the next generation of researchers in dynamic systems, mechanics of materials and metamaterials by providing funding for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and junior faculty to travel to the Fourteenth International Congress on Artificial Materials for Novel Wave Phenomena ? Metamaterials 2020, which will comprise a 4-day conference (28 September-3 October), and a 2-day Doctoral School (4-5 October). It is the first time that this highly visible international conference is held in the United States. This event will represent a unique opportunity for students and young researchers to gain exposure to the latest advancements in the field of metamaterials and to meet the leading experts in this rapidly developing field. The Doctoral School course will be focused on the optical properties of engineered low-dimensional artificial materials. The recent interest in this topic is motivated by growing interest in 2D materials, metasurfaces, valleytronics and twistronics. This grant will be used to broaden participation from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in major metamaterials conferences, particularly from women, underrepresented minorities, and researchers from universities that do not typically have the funding to travel to these events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fourteenth International Congress on Artificial Materials for Novel Wave Phenomena will provide a unique forum to share the latest results on metamaterials research and to bring together the engineering, physics, and material science communities working in the field of artificial electromagnetic materials and their applications at microwaves, millimeter waves, terahertz, and optical frequencies, as well as in acoustics, mechanics, hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. The conference program will include four plenary talks given by eminent researchers in the field of metamaterials. In addition, leading experts will present invited talks, which will review the state-of-the art and address the latest advancements in their respective areas. The Congress holds Special Symposia, comprised of invited and contributed papers, on areas deemed to be topical and of special interest to conference attendees. The technical oral talks and interactive poster sessions will encompass a broad range of topics, from fundamental electromagnetic theory of metamaterials and complex electromagnetic media to innovative microwave and optical devices, giving the opportunity to the early career scientists and engineers supported by this grant to get access to the latest advances in the area of metamaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
