<AbstractNarration>Fracture and wear are common issues in engineering - to the extent that the terms "worn," "fractured," and "broken" are generally synonymous with the end-of-utility of devices. In many cases, traditional materials fail to meet the complex, simultaneous performance requirements that would be ideal for next generation engineering systems. The enamel of the teeth of grazing animals represents one of nature's most remarkable biological materials -- a ceramic-like composite showing exceptional strength, toughness, wear-resistance, and ability to slow crack propagation. This is an important set of properties for a structure that is key to long-term survival in these animals - as functional teeth are required for feeding.  This EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will study these damage-tolerant biomaterials using a combination of evolutionary biology, biomechanics, and materials science. Results and methods from this research will be of considerable interest to investigators in many disciplines, including engineering, materials science, evolutionary biology, ecology, comparative anatomy, mammalogy, and paleontology. The research will also support the development of novel, sustainable materials with improved wear and fracture behavior. Graduate students will be involved in this truly interdisciplinary project and learn how the various fields can work together to tackle challenging questions.  This research will also introduce a more effective, evolutionary approach for exploring nature for biomimetic examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this interdisciplinary research is to specifically understand the biomechanical form, function and performance of enamel lattices, known as Modified Radial Enamel (MRE), in the grinding teeth of large herbivorous mammals.  Samples will be obtained from numerous species, including equines (horses), bovids (e.g. bison and cattle) and suids (e.g. warthogs). This study will specifically focus on how these animals' teeth endure tens to hundreds of millions of high stress contact loading cycles and impacts while chewing tough and abrasive plant matter, such as grasses whose roots are laden with hard, fracture-promoting sediment inclusions. The underlying hypothesis is that MRE is an evolutionarily optimized compromise for: 1) incredible fracture resistance due to prism arrangements that localize damage and strategically control crack direction; 2) unexpected strength and toughness made possible by compliant proteinaceous prism sheaths that circumvent hydroxyapatite's inherent brittleness; and 3) wear resistance conveyed through hard, hyper-mineralized, oriented enamel prisms. The project will investigate this hypothesis through two objectives.  First, the study will use an evolutionary biology approach to identify the ancestral enamel fabric character states to MRE that independently evolved in horses, bovids and warthogs. From this information, it will be possible to readily identify the specific evolutionary modifications to the enamel fabrics that enabled grinding and identify living species that can be used to undertake comparative biomechanical assessment.  Second, the project will investigate the structure-property relationships of the enamel across multiple length scales by comprehensively characterizing the material properties using micro-and nano-mechanical tools, spectroscopy, and advanced electron microscopy. Teeth of grinding species with MRE will be compared with close relatives that retain the ancestral enamel fabrics, thereby revealing the salient anatomical changes that enabled the optimized combination of biomechanical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
