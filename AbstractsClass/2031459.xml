<AbstractNarration>Using software tools to explore, analyze, visualize, and explain data is increasingly common. However, the development of data science skills and practices are still not common in much of K-12 education. This project will create and study "data excursions," structured activities that develop high school students' competencies with data practices and modeling within existing, phenomenon-based science curriculum. Integrating the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP), a free web-based data analysis and modeling tool designed for students in grades 6 ? 14, the data excursions will allow students to interact with existing datasets drawn from primary research. Students will learn to aggregate and represent data to explain biological phenomena such as the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and population changes in the Serengeti plains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use design-based research to investigate how working with real datasets, creating computational representations and using them to reason about ecosystem phenomena can support students' development of data science literacy. Transfer tasks, classroom observations, student interviews, and short exit surveys will be used to identify what aspects of the interventions lead to desired learning outcomes. The researchers will also develop professional learning opportunities for teachers to help them create relevant and coherent materials for students from nondominant communities. This project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
