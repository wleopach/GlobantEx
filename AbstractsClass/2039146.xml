<AbstractNarration>This project initiates Internet Measurement Research as a science driver for the FABRIC testbed.  The technical component of the project focuses on investigating three different Internet measurement systems that will be deployed in FABRIC.  The systems are complementary to the current Measurement Framework and will utilize FABRIC's unique capabilities including programmability and artificial intelligence/machine learning.  The systems can be customized, configured and launched by researchers to gather data for their studies. The organizational component of the project focuses on coordinating with the FABRIC team and outreach to the Internet measurement community to raise awareness and catalyze the use of FABRIC in research studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate, develop and deploy prototype systems for active probe-based measurement, distributed network honeypot measurement and passive measurement of physical layer metrics.  A system for measuring traffic from distributed applications within FABRIC will also be investigated. These systems will be developed as virtual machine images that can be integrated into and managed flexibly by the FABRIC Control Framework.  The technical challenges that will be addressed in this work include investigating and building the core images, integrating with specialized systems in FABRIC (including GPS, high-speed packet capture, routers, etc.), building data repositories and coordinating with testbed operations personnel to assure security policy compliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will expand FABRICâ€™s capability to support Internet measurement research, which seeks to broaden understanding of Internet structure and behavior and inform the design and development of next generation Internet systems and protocols.   The outreach component of this project will build awareness and facilitate community participation in FABRIC and development of Internet measurement systems.  The project will also influence the development of new educational materials in networking and data science at the undergraduate and graduate level. The students who work on the projects will receive guidance and training.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All software and data artifacts that emerge from this project will be available to the community.  These will include documentation for all of the prototype Internet measurement systems that will be deployed in FABRIC. Software, data, documentation and publications will be available indefinitely from http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~pb/software_data.html, and on the FABRIC testbed web pages at https://fabric-testbed.net/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
