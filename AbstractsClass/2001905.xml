<AbstractNarration>Sarah Wellons is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at Northwestern University.  She will perform large-scale computer simulations to study the lifecycle and properties of massive distant galaxies in the early Universe and to understand how they differ from nearby galaxies.   Results from this study will allow astronomers to accurately interpret observations of early galaxies.  Along with this research, Wellons will develop an astronomy course for incarcerated students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wellons will employ a combination of large-volume and as zoom-in simulations to investigate key aspects of massive galaxies at high redshifts (&gt; 2).  The simulations will explore mechanisms that quench star formation, connect physical processes at large and small size scales, and govern the kinematic evolution of massive galaxies through cosmic time.  This work will provide theoretical context for puzzling observations of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshifts, as well as set expectations for future observations of increasingly distant galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
