<AbstractNarration>This project explores one of the NSF Idea Machine Winning Entries: "Reinventing Scientific Talent." While much has been written about the challenges of the kind of interdisciplinarity present in convergence research, a thorough understanding of the knowledge, skill, and attitude competencies associated with scientific teamwork is still needed. The goal of the project is to develop a better understanding of team science competencies contributing to effective convergence science. (Team science is a collaborative effort to address a scientific challenge that leverages the strengths and expertise of professionals trained in different fields.) The project will address these gaps through an integrated set of activities that survey scholars and practitioners to examine similarities and differences in these perceptions across disciplines and experience levels. Complementing these are in-depth workshops where stakeholders provide their insights so that a richer understanding is gained. From this, a more comprehensive framework of science team competencies can be developed to inform how to reinvent scientific talent and to suggest future directions for the research of team science. Outcomes from this research will help extend the nation?s scientific capabilities by teaching scientists how to better engage in ?reciprocal learning?, that is, how to leverage their expertise and share their knowledge to nurture a stronger foundation for successful convergence research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project centers on understanding interdisciplinary team science competencies in relation to levels of experience and types of disciplinary expertise.  Although research is beginning to examine some of these issues, no studies have simultaneously examined the relation between perceptions of team science competencies, how they contribute to team effectiveness, and how scientists learn while engaged in collaborations.  The project will examine interdisciplinary clusters of researchers, each addressing their own form of convergence science.  It will explore perceptions of team science competencies, how they are best acquired, and how to create learning cultures capable of supporting the development of the teamwork skills foundational to convergence and generalizable across problem domains.  Through workshops held with these clusters, and surveys of scholars and practitioners affiliated with team science projects, the project will develop research findings and a framework representing the varied nature of convergence competencies and how these relate to learning while engaged in scientific collaborations. The project?s complementary research tasks will provide the foundation for identifying the competencies associated with team science effectiveness, and how these contribute to reciprocal learning while engaged in scientific collaborations.  The project will disseminate a report presenting findings and research recommendations through peer-reviewed publications, presentations at professional conferences, and additional outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning Program (AISL) in the Division of Research on Learning and the NSF 2026 Fund Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
