<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by investigating the use of Peer Instruction in a virtual learning environment. Decades of research have provided evidence that Peer Instruction improves student learning and engagement. However, thus far all research on Peer Instruction has been done in a face-to-face lecture setting. Many computing instructors are adopting interactive ebooks, which have the benefit of containing executable code and practice problems with immediate feedback. This project will leverage such interactive ebooks to increase the adoption of Peer Instruction by designing, building, and testing a system that will serve Peer Instruction questions in interactive ebooks. Research on this implementation of Peer Instruction has the potential to improve the number and diversity of students who succeed in STEM undergraduate courses, a goal that aligns with NSF's efforts to enhance and improve STEM education in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Peer Instruction application, called Peer+, will leverage free ebooks for pre-lecture reading and reading assessment. The system will mine existing ebooks and public question banks to identify Peer Instruction questions. The Peer+ system will be used to investigate: 1) the effect of synchronous and asynchronous online peer discussion on learning and student satisfaction; 2) the effect of Peer Instruction on retention of knowledge up to a month later; 3) the effect of Peer+ on student retention, especially for underrepresented students; and 4) how instructor attitudes and knowledge change due to a workshop and use of Peer+.  A design-based research approach will be used, based on social constructivism and expectancy-value theory.  The research is designed to both contribute to theory and also test the system in real educational settings. Both qualitative and quantitative research measures will be used to evaluate the impact of Peer+ use.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
