<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial core support to the Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA). The physics and astronomy communities cover a broad and diverse set of research efforts. As a part of the National Academies, the BPA monitors developments and assesses the health of the fields that make up this area of research. Its membership is drawn from universities, industry, and national laboratories, and its members' areas of expertise span much of the breadth of physics and astronomy. The experts involved are broadly representative of the community, and they provide their informed perspectives on issues that affect the progress and vitality of physics and astronomy research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal work to be supported by this award will be to support the board's semi-annual meetings as well as non-sponsored activities associated with the board's carrying out its responsibilities to support the physics and astronomy research communities. Another action will be the work on the next round of physics and astronomy/astrophysics decadal surveys. This award is co-funded by the Divisions of Physics, Astronomical Sciences, and Materials Research, within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
