<AbstractNarration>Life on Earth relies on forests. Providing more than just timber to humans, forests play an important role in the water and carbon balance of the planet. Forests, covering nearly a third of the planet’s continents, support more biodiversity on land than any other type of ecosystem. However, global forests have experienced wide-spread die-off in recent decades, largely in response to drought and increasing temperatures. Due to their tremendous economic, social, and ecological value—identifying where and when forests are threatened by global change remains a top priority for science. Data collected during the research, will be used to improve state-of-the-art models called the Earth System Models. By improving Earth System Models, this project will increase the ability to predict how forests will fare in future climate conditions. To increase the broader impacts of the work, the fellow will incorporate the research into teaching and workshops and share results with forest managers and other stakeholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will sample over 30 conifer species in the Klamath Mountains ecoregion of SW Oregon/NW California. The fellow will collect branch material from each species in the field and return to the laboratory for paired physiological-spectral measurements. Combining advanced imaging techniques (hyperspectral, thermal-infrared, chlorophyll fluorescence) with plant ecophysiology measurements (gas exchange, water content, vulnerability to embolism), this research will investigate spectral and physiological trait aggregation at various depths of conifer phylogenies. This work will result in the development of lineage functional types (LFTs), where evolutionary relatedness will be included in the functional diversity of conifers for improving models of the Earth System. The fellow will compare predictions of Earth System Models using existing plant functional types (based on form and biome), with the newly developed LFTs at different aggregation levels. During the project, the fellow will receive training in new areas, including Earth System Modeling and conducting phylogenetic analyses. Through annual outreach seminars at the US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, this project will inform foresters, land managers, and citizens of advances made during the research. Additionally, this research will include hands-on undergraduate training in methods of plant ecophysiology, as portions of the project will be embedded in courses as research experiences for the next generation of plant scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
