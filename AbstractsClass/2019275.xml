<AbstractNarration>NSF actively promotes the inclusion of students in technical conferences and in the advancement of scientific research. To this affect the PI requests that the CCSS program, within the ECCS Division of the Engineering Directorate at the NSF, sponsor travel of 10 graduate or undergraduate students from U.S. Institutions for attending the 10th European Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (EWSHM 2020), to be held in Palermo (Italy) from July 6-9, 2020.  The NSF support is expected to significantly promote student participation in the Meetings and to provide a unique opportunity for them to learn about emerging fields in structural health monitoring (SHM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of EWSHM 2020 Conference is to provide an open and interdisciplinary forum for researchers from a wide range of areas to discuss the latest advancements and breakthroughs in the field of SHM. The conference covers many interesting topics including, (1) Physical principles monitoring: mechanical, acoustic, electrical, thermal; (2) Signal processing, pattern recognition, modal analysis; (3) Sensors and sensor networks: nano/micro sensors, MEMS, wireless; (4) Remote sensing; (5) SHM in action: aerospace, marine, civil engineering, railway, energy generation; (6) Smart cities and SHM for the IoT; and (7) Autonomous systems, automotive; and (8) Biomedical applications and human performance monitoring. The topics represent the forefronts of Structural Health Monitoring research and applications. The NSF support is expected to significantly promote student participation in the meeting and to provide an opportunity for them to learn about emerging fields in SHM. The awardees will be part of a forum that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship through the work of people from academia and industry. Therefore, the Workshop will serve as a valuable event for U.S. students to connect with international experts in SHM in order to gain new knowledge for their future career development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
