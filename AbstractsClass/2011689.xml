<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), through Targeted Infusion Projects, supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The University of the District of Columbia aspires to support the nation?s efforts to strengthen its cybersecurity workforce by enhancing the institution?s computer science curriculum and providing more opportunities to train more students to enter said workforce. The institution is well-positioned to impact large numbers of students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields.  Successful implementation of the project will establish a model for other analogous programs at peer institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project promises to: 1) strengthen the learning experience of UDC undergraduate students by developing three new cybersecurity courses that will be part of an interdisciplinary cybersecurity minor; 2) stimulate the undergraduate students? participation in cybersecurity research by launching a summer cybersecurity research program; and 3) increase student enrollment and retention at UDC by implementing outreach activities related to cybersecurity, and by engaging existing and potential UDC students, recruited from local high schools and community colleges. It is expected that at least 600 students will be directly impacted, and benefit from, the proposed activities during the period of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
