<AbstractNarration>Increasing wildfire costs---a reflection of climate variability and development within wildlands---drive calls for new national capabilities to manage wildfires. The great potential of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has not yet been fully utilized in this domain due to the lack of holistic, resilient, flexible, and cost-effective monitoring protocols. This project will develop UAS-based fire management strategies to use autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an optimal, efficient, and safe way to assist the first responders during the fire detection, management, and evacuation stages. The project is a collaborative effort between Northern Arizona University (NAU), Georgia Institute of Technology (GaTech), Desert Research Institute (DRI), and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The team has established ongoing collaborations with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) in Pacific Northwest Research Station, Kaibab National Forest (NF), and Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management to perform multiple field tests during the prescribed and managed fires. This proposal's objective is to develop an integrated framework satisfying unmet wildland fire management needs, with key advances in scientific and engineering methods by using a network of low-cost and small autonomous UAVs along with ground vehicles during different stages of fire management operations including: (i) early detection in remote and forest areas using autonomous UAVs; (ii) fast active geo-mapping of the fire heat map on flying drones; (iii) real-time video streaming of the fire spread; and (iv) finding optimal evacuation paths using autonomous UAVs to guide the ground vehicles and firefighters for fast and safe evacuation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance the frontier of disaster management by developing: (i) an innovative drone-based forest fire detection and monitoring technology for rapid intervention in hard-to-access areas with minimal human intervention to protect firefighter lives; (ii) multi-level fire modeling to offer strategic, event-scale, and new on-board, low-computation tactics using fast fire mapping from UAVs; and (iii) a bounded reasoning-based planning mechanism where the UAVs identify the fastest and safest evacuation roads for firefighters and fire-trucks in highly dynamic and uncertain dangerous zones. The developed technologies will be translational to a broad range of applications such as disaster (flooding, fire, mud slides, terrorism) management, where quick search, surveillance, and responses are required with limited human interventions. This project will also contribute to future engineering curricula and pursue a substantial integration of research and education while also engaging female and underrepresented minority students, developing hands-on research experiments for K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is in response to the NSF Cyber-Physical Systems 20-563 solicitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
