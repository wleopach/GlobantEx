<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Alabama State University (ASU), located in Montgomery, AL, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2021- 2023. The focus of this program is to provide “Research &amp; Training in Multidisciplinary field of Regenerative Sciences for Undergraduates”.  It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from underrepresented minority groups and from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The training is aimed at students who desires to pursue a higher degree in STEM fields. The scientific advances made through the proposed projects will significantly enhance knowledge in the proposed field. A common web-based assessment SALG URSSA tool will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student projects will be organized around the fundamental themes of regenerative sciences, biomedical engineering, and developmental biology along with microbial studies and immune response studies. Faculty from the Departments of Biological Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, and Physical Sciences will serve as mentors for the program. Students will participate in a full-time closely mentored lab research project along with seminars, field trips, professional development workshops, responsible conduct of research, career opportunities in academia and industry, and the graduate school application process. Students will present their findings at a symposium during the final week of the program. Student will also submit a scientific report of their project in a manuscript format during the program. Housing, a stipend, meal and travel allowances will be provided. Students from underrepresented minority groups and from colleges with limited research opportunities are especially encouraged to apply. Students will be selected based on their interest in research, academic record, recommendation letters from their home institutions and phone interviews with potential faculty mentors. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.alasu.edu/academics/ research--centers/reu-program  and http://bioreu-alasu.org, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Komal Vig at komalvig@alasu.edu; Tel 334-604-8189) or the co-PI (Dr. Shree R. Singh at ssingh@alasu.edu). This award is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
