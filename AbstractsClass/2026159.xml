<AbstractNarration>The broader impacts of this SBIR Phase I project are in improving the quality of life of the manufacturing workers, helping U.S. manufacturers remain cost-competitive in the global market, and improving consistency in the quality of the manufactured parts. The proposed robotic cells will reduce the need for workers to perform ergonomically challenging sanding tasks and reduce the risk of worker injuries on sanding lines. The proposed technologies will enable the human operators to focus on high-level decision making and the creative aspects of the manufacturing tasks, while the robotic assistants will perform the low-level tedious tasks. This would allow human operators to collaborate more as a team and thereby improve worker productivity. Currently, there are more than 3000 companies in the U.S. alone doing composite fabrication. Most of them face challenges due to a shortage of workers and high labor churn leading to longer delivery times. The proposed work will enable manufacturers to improve quality and lower costs. Moreover, it will enable manufacturers to reduce time to part delivery by reducing reliance on human labor and easily scale production capacity with changes in demand by adding or removing robotic cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the proposed effort is to develop a robotic sanding process for high-mix applications. The technology will enable robots to program themselves by automatically generating and safely executing trajectories based on the task description, accounting for the uncertainties present in the environment. The robotic tools will reduce cycle time by fast execution of safe and efficient execution of sanding project related to the fabrication of composite materials.  A robotic sanding cell will be developed by incorporating appropriate sensors and tools, developing algorithms for fast and safe workpiece localization in the robotic cell, and assessing the post-sanding surface quality and the state of the abrasive media. The sanding instrumentation will provide recommendations to the human operator for initiating another robotic sanding pass or changing the abrasive media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
