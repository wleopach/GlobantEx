<AbstractNarration>In the 21st Century, the dominant challenge to humanity is encapsulated in the concept of sustainability. This is at its core an effort to find ways that make it possible for civilization to prosper on Earth now and in the future. By itself, this is a formidable challenge given the 7.8 billion current human population. But this challenge must be met in the face of emergent threats such as the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, wars, climate change, and others. At the local level, these emergent global threats can manifest as major disruption events like floods, droughts, forest fires, high rates of hospitalization and death, and economic distress. Therefore, the theme for TARDIS 21 is "Sustainability and Resilience in the Face of Emergent Threats." To explore this theme and find feasible and actionable pathways to manage it, the following focus questions will be addressed at TARDIS 21: (1) What are the most critical threats facing the World in the 21st Century? (2) Which of these threats are critical challenges to achieving sustainability and promoting resilience locally as well as globally? (3) What may be the most practical and effective ways to mitigate these threats? (4) What is the most practical and useful path to resilience and sustainability in the face of these threats? The workshop will be conducted in October 2021 in Miskolc, Hungary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The composition of the body of participants will be balanced to include representation with respect to discipline (engineering, physics, chemistry, economics, policy, etc.), institutions (academic, government, private sector) and regional and national representation, and (4) minorities and women. The participants will be from both the European and American communities, with the European participants being supported on non-NSF funds. The PI will work with the Technical University of Graz, the University of Miskolc, and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science to prepare a final report resulting from the workshop. This report will be made available on public websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
