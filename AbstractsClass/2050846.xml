<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of San Diego, located in San Diego, CA, provides support for 10 students for 10 weeks of research and professional development each summer from 2021-2023. In this program, supported by the Division of Chemistry, students take part in projects representing diverse approaches and techniques, giving them a unique opportunity to explore the power of multi-disciplinary science. Beyond scientific gains, students will work side-by-side with faculty mentors to engage with issues of social awareness, justice, and responsibility in Chemistry. At least half of the students are recruited from local community colleges with otherwise limited opportunities for laboratory research. To increase the retention of these students in science, the site includes programming for academic, personal, and professional development on topics such as academic preparation, financial literacy, and career paths. Working closely with mentors, students will receive professional guidance, grow their scientific identities, and develop ownership of their research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students from first-generation, underserved, and diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds will be engaged in authentic mentored research that thoughtfully integrates social justice themes. In collaboration with faculty, student researchers will synthesize and study novel organic molecules, investigate nanoscale materials, colloids and active matter; and explore atmospheric, surface, water, and plant chemistry.  Participants also have the opportunity to examine protein chemistry and biomacromolecular interactions and engage in research projects related to climate change, renewable energy, clean water, and health. In conjunction with their research activities, participating students will also consider societal implications and impact of scientific research including issues of equity, environmental justice, and access to emerging technologies. The REU student cohort will also participate in discussions with mentors, peers, and invited speakers to explore issues of diversity, equity, inclusion and access in the scientific community and in society at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
