<AbstractNarration>Hydrographic measurements of physical and biogeochemical properties in the ocean support broad research, including carbon content and uptake; ocean heat content, fluxes, and transport; surface and deep current calculations and modeling. At present, two separate data facilities are serving global hydrographic data for their respective programs. Argovis provides access and tools for data from the global array of Argo floats, which profile the oceans to record temperature, salinity, pressure, and an emerging set of biogeochemical measurements. The CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office (CCHDO) serves vessel-based data from the global Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP), providing reference-quality temperature and salinity data from repeated visits to the same locations, plus a large set of tracer, nutrient, and chemical data from analyzed water samples. The proposed work will create interoperability across these two systems, allowing scientists to search, access, and work with data from both facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on past and current investments in Argovis and GO-SHIP technologies, informed by the SeaView EarthCube Integrative Activityâ€™s experience integrating across ocean data facilities. As part of the proposed infrastructure, the databases will deliver dynamic data selection via new API capabilities and allow visualizations, co-location, and comparison on web applications otherwise not possible with simple file archives. The project will be aligned with contemporary web standards and practices. Interoperability will allow Argovis users to continue using the interface they are familiar with, with the added ability to search and integrate GO-SHIP data from a user-defined proximity to data in Argovis. GO-SHIP users will similarly be able to transition seamlessly to the new tools from the GOSHIP website and access Argovis data near GO-SHIP lines or profiles of interest. Project outcomes will be inherently sustainable: after development, the long-term maintenance of some of the tools will be covered by the ongoing GO-SHIP core support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
