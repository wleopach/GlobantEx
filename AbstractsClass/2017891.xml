<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Wisconsin Madison is acquiring a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with a flow tube accessory and dedicated software that enable online monitoring of chemical reactions in real-time under actual experimental conditions. The instrumentation supports Professor Charles Fry and colleagues at the Wisconsin High-Pressure Reactor (WiHP-NNMR). This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and nearby colleges such as Madison College, University of Wisconsin La Crosse, University of Wisconsin Rock County, University of Wisconsin Whitewater, Lawrence University, Maranatha Baptist University, Indiana State University and Valparaiso University. The Magnetic Resonance Facility plays an important role in strengthening the relationship between the University and Wisconsin citizens by working closely with departmental programs advocating the importance of science, research, and education to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts discovery of metal-metal bonded catalysts and carbon-hydrogen functionalization reactions. The instrumentation is also for exploring photoredox catalysis, polymer mechanochemistry and three-dimensional (3D) printing. In addition, it provides information on operando investigations of transition metal catalyzed reactions. An operando method involves spectroscopic characterization of materials undergoing reaction which is coupled simultaneously with measurement of catalytic activity and selectivity. The spectrometer is also used to develop catalysts for aerobic oxidation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
