<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Ceramics are present in a multitude of technological solutions that help address the current and future global challenges. Applications range from electronics in mobile devices to sensors for biohazards, but the design and fabrication of finely controlled and predictable ceramics still face significant difficulties. This project takes a transformative approach to provide a missing piece of understanding on how to control the evolution of ceramic structures during processing and operations. By using experimental approaches utilizing sophisticated techniques, including quantification of microscale heat evolution- and high-resolution electron microscopy, the research introduces a method to measure interfacial energies – currently largely unknown – which hold the key for predictive manufacturing and design. The project also has important education components that focus on the promotion of engineering in middle and high schools with a series of educational activities based on the science behind superheroes. These are effective vehicles to inspire students to join science and engineering fields by discussing the fantastic universe of superheroes from a technological perspective. The project also provides training of undergraduate and graduate students in research and development in this strategic field, with graduates in this field typically finding positions in high-tech electronics companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The predictability of manufacturing and design of ceramics strongly relies on a solid understanding of the thermodynamics of interfaces. Direct measurements of interfacial energies is therefore a key element for evolution of the field into being less dependent on empirical evidences and trends. This project applies microcalorimetric techniques to measure interface energies of ceramics, using yttrium oxide as a model system, and combines the results with detailed microstructural and structural analyses to deliver unprecedented data. The first research product presents a methodology for broad application in other materials, which is complemented by a careful study on how to control interfacial energies. Such control optimizes compositional design in industries, enabling more energy and cost-efficient products, and improves reliability during operation. From an education perspective, students are mentored and conduct research with strategic materials and processes, receiving training on highly advanced techniques to be applied in their future careers as materials’ professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
