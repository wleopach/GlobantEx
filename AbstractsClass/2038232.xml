<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project will create and implement a promising, novel but untested, approach for the evaluation of convergence research projects.  The effort proposed will create an evidence-based framework and set of appropriate indicators of processes and results for convergence research; however, this evaluation approach will also be relevant for most types of basic research. This addresses a significant challenge in the field of evaluationâ€”given that basic research processes often evolve and change from initial proposals and desired results often emerge long after the grant funding ends.  This project, if successful, has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of evaluation and thus will also strengthen the capacity of agencies and other funders of basic research to generate and use evidence about the efficiency and effectiveness of their investments to inform decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important technical aspect of this proposal is that it proposes a highly innovative use of bibliometric data and advanced statistical modelling as inputs into the development of an assessment framework (e.g., theory of change, logic model, evaluation questions, indicators). Typically, these techniques are used to answer evaluation questions, not on the front-end of design.  The other data sources for this project include literature reviews, agency stakeholder interviews, and scaffolding of information from document review of convergence research resources. The deliverables from this project include: a landscape study, a theory of change, and logic model for convergence research, and a set of preliminary indicators. The anticipated outcomes of this project include: (1) an increase in knowledge of key convergence research concepts and change mechanisms, (2) the emergence of common measures to guide the generation and use of evidence in ways that, (3) inform and catalyze decisions across a broad landscape of funders in the field of basic research and the scientific communities they serve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Exploring Conergence Research      Federal agencies and other funders have encouraged and accelerated the deep integration of disciplines to resolve pressing societal problems through Convergence Research.  We examine what is meant by Convergence Research and how it differs from other types of research through literature review, bibliometric analyses, and stakeholder interviews. We address three areas: Foundations, Theory and Practice, and Success.      Foundations  Convergence Research is most accurately characterized as a domain of research activities and practices, and cannot be described by a single definition. We drew several key foundational insights from the differing views found in the literature. First, Convergence Research is a complex form of research that crosses disciplinary boundaries where knowledge is both shared and integrated. Second, Convergence Research is conducted by heterogeneous teams looking to address grand challenges in research and society. s. Third, these individuals have alliances, allegiances, and affiliations with equally diverse organizations. As such, Convergence Research is a system of complex systems.     National Science Foundation (NSF) (2017) calls out two defining features of Convergence Research:  1)     Research driven by a specific and compelling problem.   2)     Deep integration across disciplines. lines can form sustained interactions across multiple communities.[1]  Building on the NSF definition, we posit that the designation of Convergence Research can be applied to projects that:  Address complex problems; Integrate knowledge, tools, language and cultures, and ways of thinking in a manner that requires the crossing of disciplinary boundaries; and Require a highly collaborative approach to problem definition and problem solution.          Theory and Practice     We identified a framework for understanding, and ultimately assessing, the implementation and outcomes of Convergence Research. This framework includes three components: Collaboration, Inquiry, and Contextual systems.  Collaboration: Addressing the grand challenges examined through Convergence Research requires heterogenous teams of researchers. We found that the topic of collaboration, what it means to truly collaborate and the challenges in doing so when a heterogeneous team is involved, was a topic that received considerable attention in the literature, the bibliometric analyses, and the interviews. Diversity in teams can be a powerful, positive disruptive force for addressing complex problems because it brings multiple perspectives, backgrounds, habits of minds, and investigative stances to tackle grand challenges. The need to develop effective patterns of communication emerged as a central requirement for success.     Inquiry: The research, development, and innovation cycle forms the backbone of Convergence Reseas it aspires to address complex research and societal problems. Writers agree that it is essential to create a common space in which to develop the research questions and initiate a process of exchanging and broadening the researchersâ€™ worldviews, language, methods, beliefs about evidence, and investigative stance. Effective Convergence Research involves cycles of convergence and divergence, ultimately leading to an innovative solution that profits from the diversity of knowledge, skills, and values.   Contextual: The context of Convergence Research consists primarily of higher education, research, and funding systems, which are typically siloed by discipline. Governance, rewards, and incentives all operate within the siloed environments, and typical norms of operation reinforce unit or organization independence. Preparation of new researchers is strongly influenced by this siloing, with the need to establish disciplinary expertise and identity being poorly aligned with the basic tenets of Convergence Research and the timelines of most projects.  Convergence Research that aspires to cross those boundaries will require cultural change, creative incentive systems, and structural modification.  Success     Although there is discussion in the inter- and transdisciplinary literatures about what success might look like, those insights do not transfer seamlessly to Convergence Research. For example, the broader literature does not address how to measure all aspects of research and collaboration success in any depth. To the extent that it is considered, discussions focus more on such proximal outcomes or early milestones as creating a common knowledge vision or developing working practices and procedures to guide team interactions. Very little has been written about what might constitute the longer term success of Convergence Research. It is clear that this question of what is meant by success and how those engaged in Convergence Research can contribute to its success is underspecified in the work and thinking identified to date.     Based on our explorations and what we have learned, we developed logic models that describe Convergence Research what is involved, what it hopes to accomplish, and how it is managed.  These logic models are intended to provide the scaffolding for a range of possible assessment activities.  Recommendations are offered both for next steps in using these logic models to support evaluation and for conducting research that can provide a deeper understanding of Convergence Research and how current efforts can be improved. Specifically:       [1] It should be noted that given the newness of the Convergence Research literature, most of our references are to the antecedents of Convergence Research.
