<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project would be to develop a novel electromechanical system for on-orbit servicing of spacecraft so that a spacecraft can be captured, dock. and refuel.  This system will extend the useful life of spacecraft and enable the rescue of failed missions, representing savings to commercial and public entities alike.  Mission life extensions of commercial projects are expected to translate into reduced costs of delivering information and services; similarly, extensions of government-sponsored missions will enable lowered costs associated with satellite launches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will create a capture and refueling system for spacecraft to be used in ride-share systems.   Capturing system requirements include:  compatibility with proximity and guidance sensors; low-power operation; and autonomous alignment.  Docking and refueling requirements include: formation of a rigid, leak-proof, structural connection to deliver fuel; and a mechanism to open the fuel port on the client spacecraft without secondary actuation systems.  Finally, for ride-share compatibility, the robot arm must be optimized for size, weight, and power; and it must have end-effectors and a tool exchange mechanism.   All subsystems must be fully compatible with the extreme environmental conditions of space.  The proposed effort will address the systems engineering process of developing requirements and specifications; conceptual design development; detailed design, analysis and modeling; and breadboard testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project began with the development of requirements for a system that can be established as a standard for all future capturing and docking capabilities, on-orbit, and for a system that is capable of ride-share launches that would considerably decrease costs.  Heretofore, there is no system that meets both of these sets of requirements.  The project successfully executed a work plan that also included: conceptual designs development, detailed design, analyses and modeling, and the fabrication, demonstration and testing of both the capturing and docking systems.   During the development effort, key hurdles were addressed.  These include: compatibility with existing or developing proximity and guidance sensor suites; effectiveness, electromagnetically, within the range of capture provided by the sensor suites without requiring burdensome power requirements; adequate compliance, during the capture sequence, in order to compensate for misalignments; packaging to form a rigid structural connection that is also a leak proof conduit for delivering fuel; and a docking sequence that includes means for opening the fuel port on the spacecraft to be serviced, without using secondary actuation systems.  To complement this development and fully enable commercial on-orbit servicing (OOS) activities, it is envisioned that a robotic arm will need to be optimally designed for size, weight and power in order to fit into ride-share compatible launch systems and furthermore, an entire suite of end-effectors and tool change-out mechanisms will also have to be developed.  The executed effort, to develop a system for the assembly, repair, and servicing of on-orbit space assets, helps to realize a key capability for interplanetary exploration; it can also play a significant role in near-term commercial applications.  Spacecraft owners may spend billions of dollars to build and launch a spacecraft and in rare exceptions, like the Hubble Space Telescope, these spacecrafts will never be serviced.  NASA and DARPA have supported various servicing missions but often at great expense and complexity as most spacecrafts are not designed with on-orbit servicing in mind.  Commercial spacecrafts, in particular those in the communications industry, may regularly generate $500k-$1M per day in revenue so even relatively simple life extension can add tremendous value.  Satellites with faulty deployments such as a solar array or antenna may be a total loss, incapable of performing their primary mission, often at the cost of an insurance company.  Payouts in excess of $100M are not uncommon.  In these instances, a satellite owner may be willing to pay millions or tens of millions of dollars for a repair or life extension service and in these cases they have no other options.  It is either total loss of revenue or pay for the service that the work of this effort offers when taken to its logical conclusion, that is, commercialization.  For these reasons, the developed system, modular, with standardized interfaces, and compatibility with low-cost, ride share launch systems can be made into an indispensable and commercially successful tool for on-orbit servicing.  The Phase I effort emphatically demonstrated capturing and docking of two representative spacecrafts, while meeting a set of requirements that were derived and developed for the system.  In docking, the two spacecrafts became a single vehicle achieving both mechanical (structural) and electrical continuity.  These features, by themselves, enable the permanent placement of an avionics box or other subsystem upgrade to expand the life or improve the efficiency of an on-orbit asset.  Uniquely, the OOS system is capable of being packaged as an ESPA class payload which means that it is lightweight, compact, simple, and can be launched on ride-share opportunities.  The last of these is significant as it can lead to the development of a fleet of low-cost servicing spacecrafts with the ability to perform on-orbit tasks, such as, refueling.  Further development is expected to build on the significant, hardware-proven, progress made during this effort, and demonstrate refueling of a representative spacecraft, after capturing and docking.  This development will also improve the design of a ?Standard Client Interface? such that it may be adapted by spacecraft builders/designers as a ?standard? means of enabling on-orbit servicing, as noted.  The fully developed OOS system may also be designed to be capable of de-orbiting inactive space vehicles; this will help to reduce orbiting clutter.
