<AbstractNarration>Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. The project at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) seeks to increase undergraduate matriculation in the institution?s Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering program.  The PI intends to implement integrative persistence models that are specific to the department, enhance mathematics education, and recruit and retain more students who are typically underrepresented in the discipline.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project incorporates next generation educational directions for employing evidence-based active STEM learning practices targeting perseverance in Freshman and Sophomores (Froshmores).  The specific objectives of the project are (1) to understand the role of augmented reality in conceptualized learning of calculus for STEM targeted skill attainment in the Froshmore years, (2) to assist with research integration for acquiring critical thinking skills, and (3) to provide industry advocacy as an enhanced professional student model level to improve retention of Froshmore students at FAMU. The methods employ targeted inclusion and retention of women through a two-semester course incorporating (1) inductive learning techniques and (2) course-based undergraduate research experiences, also known as CUREs. Novel learning practices, such as augmented reality tools (e.g. guided book and media materials) are used to created conceptualized math curriculum for learning and retention.  The FAMU Catalyst award will assess the impact of the program on guiding Froshmores through nascent STEM careers. The project will use evidence-based, critical-thinking assessments to educate faculty about continuous improvement needs of the curriculum and engage students in active problem-solving scenarios. A broader element of the project is the Industry advocacy panel (community engagement) which will assist in student mentorship, badge certifications and provide research-based projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
