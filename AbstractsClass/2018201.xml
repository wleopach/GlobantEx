<AbstractNarration>This award will provide The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) with an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer, an instrument capable of producing data on the relative abundance of chemical elements in many types of samples.  The instrument and the data produced will support a range of on-going and planned projects ranging from study of the nature and origin of saline groundwater, the origin and sourcing of dust, the cycling of nutrients in soils, and the quality of water treated through desalination and other methods to improve water quality. The instrument will also be used as a training tool for students from a broad range of backgrounds to investigate research questions in the Paso del Norte region and surrounding areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will be used to acquire an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer, with add-ons to allow for measurement in the far ultraviolet (UV) allowing for the analysis of halogens. The instrument will be used to identify and quantify the elemental composition of: 1) water samples; 2) soil and rock leachates; and 3) digestions of non-liquid biological and geological materials. The instrument will enable and expand diverse research and training in Earth, biological, and environmental sciences and civil engineering, as well as workforce training and scholastic development at The University of Texas at El Paso. The instrument (Horiba Ultima Expert) and nitrogen generator (Peak Scientific NG5000A) are ideal for elemental quantification in liquid samples from a broad range of matrixes, including the analysis of elements in very saline solutions corresponding to brines (up to and exceeding 300,000 mg/L total dissolved solids) which are found in sedimentary basins in the region. The new instrument will be used to produce data for studies on: 1) aqueous geochemistry in arid and saline systems; 2) dryland element cycling; and 3) evaluation and testing of brackish and saline water treatment methods. Access to such an instrument will advance continuing research on soil, water, and air quality in light of evolving agricultural, climatic, and land-use conditions. Given relative simplicity of sample operation and robust design of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometers, instrument acquisition will allow for direct-use experience and data utilization in student projects and coursework at both the graduate and undergraduate level. The instrument will be integrated in undergraduate research provides an exceptional training and experiences for students at UTEP, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
