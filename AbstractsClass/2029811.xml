<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of precision laser sensing for vehicular navigation and safety.  Recently, there has been a substantial commercial effort to build modular light detection and ranging (LiDAR) units to achieve the perception stack of autonomous and robotic-drone platforms. However, most state-of-the-art LiDAR sensors are based on mechanically rotating laser arrays or bulk solid-state lasers that are large, heavy, consume high-power and are difficult to scale. Recent results have demonstrated a chip-scale LiDAR architecture based on on-chip lasers and optoelectronics, enabling a solid-state approach with high performance. In this I-Corps program, the goal is to identify potential customers and market of highest need through the customer discovery process, and to develop a detailed and robust business model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of precision laser sensing for vehicular navigation and safety and supported by preliminary chip demonstrations in the laboratory. Using this technology, the 3D vehicular surroundings may be mapped via laser time-of-flight reflection. Together with modeling and design parameter analysis, performance of the LiDAR chip has been examined using advances in the photonic design, coupled with advances in the laser precision measurements and thresholds, and detector signal-to-noise ratio. The photonic implementation is scalable through the foundry processing compared to prior studies on bulk rotating laser arrays or bulky solid-state lasers.  This chip-scale laser sensing technology may enable the readiness level of autonomous vehicle sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
