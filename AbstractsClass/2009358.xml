<AbstractNarration>The 1st US-North Africa conference on Nanotechnology Convergence for Sustainable Energy, Health, and Environment  will take place in Cairo, Egypt from August 9th through August 14th, 2020 at the Grand Nile Tower Hotel. The main goal of this conference is to advance the interdisciplinary research in science and engineering by showcasing and highlighting new ideas to improve, and revolutionize, science, engineering and technology in the United States. Areas of focus include  quantum information technology, nanomedicine, energy harvesting, and environmental science. The result of this conference will be the stimulation of international research collaborations between US and North Africa which will advance scientific research and education. Through this conference, U.S. students will learn about  opportunities to engage in international research projects, which will be established through the networking events of researchers at the conference. In addition, the conference will promote cultural diversity and broaden participation within science and engineering fields. The conference will provide a great opportunity for discussion between researchers (including undergrad-graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty from the US and North Africa, setting up a concrete foundation on which to initiate research collaborations. Egypt is one of the major North African countries  engaged in the convergence of nanotechnology in energy, health and environment and the conference will be hosted by the Academy of scientific research and technology (ASRT), Egypt. In addition, the co-chairs will invite the keynote speakers to publish their unique research in the Journal of Nanoparticle Research and the invitation will be opened for the development of a special journal l issue to include all innovative and transformative research from attendees. The successful outcome of this conference will be the development of solid US-NA research collaborations that can serve to promote science and engineering research and education in both regions.&lt;br/&gt;The 1st US-North Africa conference on Nanotechnology Convergence for Sustainable Energy, Health, and Environment will take place in Cairo, Egypt from August 9th through August 14th, 2020 at the Grand Nile Tower Hotel. The conference will highlight state-of-the-art research, recent achievements and global trends in nanotechnology in the US and North Africa using 1) a transdisciplinary integration of presentations on fundamental science, engineering, industrial and medical applications that address global challenges in sustainable energy, environment and health and 2) stimulation and  facilitation of research collaborations among participants. The conferenceâ€™ sessions will include important research topics such as quantum computing, energy harvesting, environmental applications, drug delivery, diagnoses and cancer treatment. The conference will feature daily open discussions among attendees through short group meetings which will includes students, postdocs, and keynote speakers to foster an environment of collegiality and collaboration. The conference will also include three breakout sessions in energy, health and environment during which a list of research challenges in each of these areas will be developed. Within these topical challenges, potential international research collaboration opportunities will be identified. Towards the fulfillment of this aim, a listing  of participants,  research areas and contact information will be created after the conference and distributed to attendees.  The conference will discuss the emerging, current fundamental concepts and practices that describe: 1) synthesis of novel functional nanomaterials for energy storage and conversion devices, 2) Quantum molecular nanomagnets for new generation of quantum computing, 3) Environmental application of nanomaterials such as water treatment, crop protection, and climate change, and 4) Nano-Biomaterials and their applications for drug delivery, diagnosis, and cancer therapy. In addition, the co-chairs will invite the keynote speakers to publish their unique research in the Journal of Nanoparticle Research and the invitation will be opened for the development of a special journal l issue to include all innovative and transformative research from attendees. The successful outcome of this conference will be the development of solid US-NA research collaborations that can serve to promote science and engineering research and education in both regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
