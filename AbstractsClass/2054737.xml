<AbstractNarration>There are many excellent researchers from numerous scientific fields scattered across the EPSCoR jurisdictions. This workshop aims to bring these scientists together in an environment designed to stimulate and foster competitive research collaborations between artificial intelligence (AI) experts and domain scientists/researchers outside computational science. This workshop will provide invaluable opportunities for researchers from EPSCoR jurisdictions to learn and understand the current research and accomplishments of their peers, and discuss opportunities for establishing cross-jurisdictional, inter-disciplinary collaborations. The workshop planning committee will ensure broad participation of NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions, underserved groups, and HBCUs. The workshop will have sessions for AI in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), health and medicine, humanities and social science. During the workshop, there will be prestigious keynote speakers from a diversity of research fields, short research presentations, panel discussions and a poster session. The agenda will also include specifically designed training sessions to practice the principles discussed and provide opportunities for training students and researchers from all disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring researchers together to discuss current frontier research as well as potentials and limitations of AI in addressing science challenges from various disciplines. These disciplines include STEM, statistics, business, art, law, journalism, social science, linguistics, history, etc. The workshop focus is defining problems and challenging science questions from varied domains where it is critical to bring AI knowledge together with domain knowledge. “No-Boundary Thinking (NBT) is no-boundary problem defining on time-chain to address real science challenges”. The anticipated workshop outcomes include: (1) Development of collaborative research projects with AI experts and domain scientists; (2) Planning for the development of an EPSCoR National AI-Campus for AI training and education; (3) Building strong collaborations and connections among NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions, continuing to foster research collaborations among NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions (and beyond); (4) Enhancing opportunities for students to develop AI knowledge and technology, as well as to intellectually, technically, and geographically broaden their opportunities for career development. A workshop website will be established to facilitate participation and allow the public to track the resources addressed during the workshop. There will also be contacts and links to the groups of other EPSCoR jurisdictions. All participating faculty will be invited to submit a two-page summary highlighting their research methodology, and both research and educational achievements of their current funded and unfunded research work. These summaries will be published in pre-conference proceedings to be distributed to all conference attendees. Furthermore, all conference presentations will be compiled in a post-conference proceeding. We will gather and compile news, photos and videos of the collaborative research activities at the workshop and to make the information available to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
