<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this hypothesis-driven research proposal is to prepare cellulose nanomaterials that perform as advanced functional materials. This will be accomplished by utilizing existing feedstocks of nanocellulose, primarily cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), as a platform for the development of a new class of advanced functional nanomaterials. These nanomaterials represent a promising platform for the attachment of  specially designed polymer chains to allow the transformation of simple, renewable, and abundant agricultural products into optically and electrically active components that can be used in advanced applications. The research goal entails the following: the researchers will (a) prepare and characterize CNC modified with semiconducting polymers, (b) process the new materials into thin films and gels and gain a detailed understanding of their morphology, (c) demonstrate the advanced properties of these new materials in light-emitting applications by fabricating and testing devices. The fundamental questions answered by this project are applicable to a community of scientists and engineers beyond those directly involved in the synthesis of semiconducting polymers, cellulose, devices and nanofabrication. Adaptation of cellulose nanomaterials as a feedstock in future products could reduce our reliance on ecologically ?challenged? raw materials and boost US-based agriculture and biomass production. The project will provide research training and education of a graduate student who will be trained in new synthesis techniques, advanced characterization methods, and learn how to implement nanomaterials into actual industrial fabrication processes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this hypothesis-driven research proposal is to prepare cellulose nanomaterials that perform as advanced functional materials. This will be accomplished by utilizing existing feedstocks of nanocellulose, primarily cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), as a platform for the development of a new class of nanomaterials. These nanomaterials represent a promising  platform for the attachment of semiconducting polymer moieties to allow the transformation of simple, renewable, and abundant hydrocarbons to optically and electrically active components that can be used in advanced applications. The goal will be accomplished through a project involving  (a) preparation and characterization of CNC modified with semiconducting polymers, (b) processing the new materials into thin films and gels and gaining an understanding of their morphology, and (c) studying the advanced properties of these new materials for electroluminescence applications by fabricating and testing PLEO and LEEC devices. The project will provide research training and education of a graduate student and contribute to enhancing diversity and exploration of commercial potential for these new materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
