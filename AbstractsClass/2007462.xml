<AbstractNarration>While computers have revolutionized our world, the resources&lt;br/&gt;required to perform computational tasks are poorly understood.&lt;br/&gt;Developing a mathematical theory of computation is crucial in our&lt;br/&gt;information age, where computers are involved in essentially every&lt;br/&gt;part of our life. Computational complexity, the study of the amount&lt;br/&gt;of resources needed to perform computational tasks, is essential&lt;br/&gt;for understanding the power of computation and for the development&lt;br/&gt;of a theory of computation. It is also essential in designing&lt;br/&gt;efficient communication protocols and secure cryptographic protocols,&lt;br/&gt;and in understanding human and machine learning. Proving lower&lt;br/&gt;bounds for the resources required by different computational&lt;br/&gt;models, and for different computational tasks, is among the most&lt;br/&gt;exciting, most challenging and most important topics in theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science. The project will study computational complexity&lt;br/&gt;lower bounds, focusing on two research directions: Lower bounds&lt;br/&gt;related to learning; and, studying the relative power of quantum&lt;br/&gt;and classical computational models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more details, we will focus on the following directions. (1)&lt;br/&gt;Memory-Samples lower bounds for learning: memory/samples lower&lt;br/&gt;bounds for online learning algorithms is a very exciting research&lt;br/&gt;direction that has been studied in a line of recent work. For&lt;br/&gt;example, it was proved that any algorithm for learning parities&lt;br/&gt;requires either a memory of quadratic size or an exponential number&lt;br/&gt;of samples. The project will further study memory/samples lower&lt;br/&gt;bounds for learning and their relations to other topics in&lt;br/&gt;computational complexity. (2) The relative power of quantum and&lt;br/&gt;classical computational models: The project will study gaps between&lt;br/&gt;quantum and classical complexity in various models. In particular, it&lt;br/&gt;will investigate separations between quantum and classical communication complexity,&lt;br/&gt;as well as the relative power of quantum and classical algorithms&lt;br/&gt;in the context of memory/samples trade-offs for learning. (3)&lt;br/&gt;Circuit complexity lower bounds related to learning: The amazing&lt;br/&gt;success of machine learning, and in particular deep learning,&lt;br/&gt;motivates a study of closely related computational models. The&lt;br/&gt;project will study linear-threshold circuits and other models of&lt;br/&gt;circuits that are related to learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
