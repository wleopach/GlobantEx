<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to generate an integrated model analyzing biogeophysical and socioeconomic processes and responses to environmental transformation.  Natural disasters have incurred direct damages costing an estimated $18 B a year, and the average net benefit of investing in more resilient infrastructure is $4.2 T.   Proactive adaptation can significantly reduce both the direct and indirect costs associated with climate hazards and natural disasters, protecting people, homes, lifestyles and businesses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses risk management associated with environmental transformation, bridging the biophysical and social sciences and informed by real-time observations. The project aims to provide a first proof-of-concept of an advanced model representing a range of integrated environmental risks, such as erosion, flooding, food security, etc. The research and development effort will focus on: 1) Integrating biophysical sensitivities to to produce risk factors for hazards of concern; 2) Including community engagement to identify which biophysical sensitivities translate to socioecological vulnerabilities or opportunities; and 3) Identifying outcomes of the socioeconomic vulnerability assessments and scenarios. The envisioned proof-of-concept is a cost-effective, data-driven solution for proactive management of environmental transformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Two Bears Environmental Consulting, LLC (TBEC) used the SBIR NSF Phase I grant to develop the proof of concept for creating Climate Impact Statements and Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Impact Statements. The CIS primarily evaluates the risks to infrastructure and lifelines and provides potential adaptation strategies to reduce the economic effects. ICARIS builds on the CIS by including the social, ecological, and cultural vulnerabilities based on Traditional Knowledge and community societal concerns (Figure 1).

Alaskan Native Tribal Chiefs, Elders, Administrators, Councils, and community members are offered potential impacts of futures climates on the biophysical and socioeconomic processes in the context of their lifestyles and cultures. They are provided tools to preview what the future may look like in 10, 50, or 100 years to choose the actions they would like to take today to adapt and maintain their culture for future generations.</p> <p>The ICARIS compares historical processes (e.g., flooding, erosion, drought, food security, public health, etc.) with the changes in future processes so villagers can better understand their climate risks, including the ?no-action? option. The ICARIS is adaptive, comparing the ability of potential management strategies to reduce risks; the benefits associated with each action can be evaluated separately and cumulatively, as well as the success of each action. For example, did the action reduce the magnitude and timing of the targeted climate hazard to the degree expected? Were conditions improved to a level greater than baseline, if that was the expectation? ICARIS is a living document, changing as community objectives shift and as new data is available. It is an interactive process to bring stakeholders together, and to increase the understanding of climate risks and hazards, generate discussion, and develop a plan forward to increase community resilience. The villages cannot reduce the probability of a flood event, but they can reduce the flood?s impact by raising homes above the expected flood levels. Not only does the ICARIS support comparisons between potential options, but it is also a quick visual to demonstrate what processes are being impacted between communities, enabling between-community comparisons. ICARIS gives Native Alaskans a voice and a role in taking control of their futures, empowering community members to be proactive instead of reactive in planning for climate change.</p> <p>Because Alaska?s environment is changing and projected to continue to change, planning and adaptation for environmental change are necessary to reduce community vulnerability.
