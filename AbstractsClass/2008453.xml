<AbstractNarration>The underlying hardware for flash memory-based solid-state drive (SSD) is becoming increasingly unreliable, and the current state-of-the-art approaches implement performance-sacrificing techniques to prevent data loss. This problem is exacerbated as the storage ages, causing performance unpredictability and making performance anomaly detection difficult. In the current capacity-invariant interface where the storage device exports a fixed capacity throughout its lifetime, an SSD has no other choice but to trade performance for reliability as it wears out. This project rethinks the existing storage interface from a holistic perspective by exploiting tradeoffs among capacity, performance, and reliability (CPR) and designing a flexible capacity-variant interface that allows the SSD to maintain performance while it gracefully reduces the number of exported blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves three research thrusts. The first thrust is to quantify the error-induced performance degradation by building an SSD aging framework. The second thrust then builds a capacity-variant system and demonstrates the effectiveness of such an approach. Lastly, the project studies how capacity-variance can be extended across a heterogeneous aggregation of SSDs. The project is expected to have a major impact in the storage industry, as the problem it addresses is both timely and likely to get worse if left unchecked. A capacity-variant storage system can make storage system maintenance and provisioning easier, and this project will help educate students on the value and importance of cross-layer optimization and holistic design thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
