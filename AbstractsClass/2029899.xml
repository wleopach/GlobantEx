<AbstractNarration>Rural landscapes have become increasingly appreciated as forms of cultural heritage in their own right, with rich histories on par with those of urban spaces. Policies aimed at the preservation of these landscapes must frequently contend, however, with the ongoing use of these places by local communities, whose needs may run counter to those of conservation. At the same time, growing water and food crises worldwide have led to renewed research aimed at understanding the functions of ancient agricultural systems and the possibility of their adaptation for sustainable and effective use in the present. Critical to the objectives of both conservation and sustainable adaptation of these rural landscapes is an understanding of the social contexts in which ancient agricultural systems functioned, the motivations for their initial construction, and the reasons for their successes or failures over the long term. Archaeological methods and approaches are well-suited for addressing these issues due to the time-depth of archaeological study, allowing for the investigation of rural changes through time and the responses of communities in the face of social and environmental challenges. This study will evaluate the sustainability of ancient agricultural technologies as well as probe the ongoing role of local communities in ensuring their maintenance and continuing functionality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the long-term history of construction, use, maintenance, and abandonment of agricultural terraces. It investigates a city that has seen rapid urban expansions and gradual demographic declines, thereby serving as an ideal context in which to investigate the social and environmental conditions under which agricultural systems stay in use, are transformed, abandoned, and revitalized. Contrary to conventional narratives that focus exclusively on the city context, the associated hinterlands have been occupied at varying intensities for long periods. There is growing evidence that during this time the hinterlands have continued to be cultivated and modified. The assumption that much of the rural infrastructure (i.e., terraces, dams, cisterns, and canals) must have been built during the heyday of the city, is thus worth questioning. This project will apply a wide range of dating approaches to determine the chronology of terrace construction and use, shedding light both on how long certain agricultural systems remained in use, as well as where. Through detailed mapping and survey, the diversity of terrace types and functions will also be recorded, showing the many ways in which local communities have modified and utilized these landscapes. Altogether, by better understanding why, where, and how terraces were historically built, used, and abandoned, this research will inform contemporary policy making on heritage management and rural revitalization through its long-term perspective on the formation of rural landscapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
