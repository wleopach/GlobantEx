<AbstractNarration>Like scientists in virtually every field, astronomers are struggling under a&lt;br/&gt;"data deluge". While the ever-larger images obtained by the newest&lt;br/&gt;observatories lead to cutting-edge science, they also overwhelm traditional&lt;br/&gt;tools designed to work with files hundreds or thousands of times smaller&lt;br/&gt;than the state-of-the-art. In particular, astronomers are rapidly losing the&lt;br/&gt;ability to simply look at the images of the sky that are coming out of their&lt;br/&gt;telescopes. The FastTract Project will solve this problem by marrying existing&lt;br/&gt;Web-based visualization technologies in the AAS WorldWide Telescope software&lt;br/&gt;system with new features and tools needed to efficiently work with the large&lt;br/&gt;astronomical images of the 2020's, enabling US astronomers to fully exploit&lt;br/&gt;their world-class facilities, in particular the ones that open new Windows on&lt;br/&gt;the Universe. The project team will synthesize the insight gained in this&lt;br/&gt;undertaking to establish the Little Big Data University (LBDU), a learning&lt;br/&gt;resource for scientists across disciplines who are struggling to stay afloat&lt;br/&gt;in the "data deluge". LBDU will follow the Khan Academy model and extensively&lt;br/&gt;use interactive environments to help researchers and others learn strategies&lt;br/&gt;for Harnessing the Data Revolution. These efforts will especially benefit&lt;br/&gt;people who do not have access to top-tier computational resources, such as&lt;br/&gt;those at small institutions and interested non-specialists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FastTract Project will create a sustainable cyberinfrastructure (CI)&lt;br/&gt;system and associated community of practice that enable exploratory scientific&lt;br/&gt;visualization of large (gigapixel+) astronomical images over the Web. The CI&lt;br/&gt;will build on the NSF-funded AAS WorldWide Telescope (WWT) software system.&lt;br/&gt;The research team will extend WWT's image tiling architecture to work with&lt;br/&gt;FITS data files, develop the tooling needed for easy creation of such tiles,&lt;br/&gt;and produce workflows and tutorials allowing the broad astronomical community&lt;br/&gt;to take ownership of the infrastructure. The team will work with three&lt;br/&gt;NSF-funded partners on specific science applications. Annual workshops will&lt;br/&gt;nucleate a core group of project user-contributors and ensure that development&lt;br/&gt;effort meets the needs of the broader community. The project will adopt best&lt;br/&gt;practices in the open-source, open-development paradigm, laying the groundwork&lt;br/&gt;for FastTract infrastructure to be leveraged by non-astronomical communities&lt;br/&gt;facing similar data challenges. In parallel, the team will distill its&lt;br/&gt;expertise to create the Little Big Data University (LBDU), an online&lt;br/&gt;professional development resource aimed at domain scientists who do not intend&lt;br/&gt;to become CI specialists. These scientists will learn core strategies for&lt;br/&gt;coping with ever-larger data sets through the empirically successful Khan&lt;br/&gt;Academy model. Telemetry analysis and focus groups will guide curriculum&lt;br/&gt;design and assess efficacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
