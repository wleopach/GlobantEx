<AbstractNarration>The overall thrust of this project is to develop an integrated simulation tool to evaluate the combined effect of technology change, economics, and policy on the environmental impact of solar photovoltaics (PVs) over time in the US. It will provide outcomes including 1) a novel module database and classification method for PV modules, 2) the identification of factors that contribute to module selection, 3) the material inventory, toxicity, and recyclability of current and future PV technologies, 4) the life cycle assessment of modules manufactured, used and recycled in the US and 5) an integrated simulation tool to calculate the cost and life cycle environmental impact of PV systems that will be adapted for education and outreach activities. The simulation tool developed in this work will be used for research, teaching, and outreach and facilitate discussion of the tradeoffs associated with PV compared to other energy technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on preliminary findings and published work, the investigator hypothesizes that 1) the average lifetime of modules has been overestimated since repowering due to technology improvement, policy and economic incentives are not considered, 2) the environmental benefit of PV has been overestimated since electricity generation is not estimated based on the module’s electrical performances based on location, future grid carbon footprint and material inventory from new modules designs, 3) early module retirement can create a market for second-life PV modules, 4) the composition and toxicity of PV modules has changed in the last decade, 5) the value of PV modules over time decreases while complexity is increasing which will increase the cost for recycling 100% of the modules, 6) an integrative simulation model can help anticipate the combined effect of technology economic and policy changes on the optimal PV system size based on location and its associated life cycle cost and environmental impact and 7) an educative simulation tool for sustainability education can help train skilled engineers to work in energy sector. This proposal’s objectives represent important steps toward sustainable solar technologies by proposing a comprehensive analysis of current and future PV technologies. It seeks to provide insight on the combined impact of technology, policy, use, recycling, and disposal of PV in the US. The characterization of the material, toxicity, and value of the waste stream is required to plan regulations and/or mandatory recycling to prevent toxic waste. The research will address public concerns about PV that will be incorporated into outreach and teaching tools to help increase trust in PV technology. Life cycle inventory data collected from this work will be submitted for inclusion US LCA Commons. Also, the investigator will (1) develop a new class on life cycle assessment of energy for undergraduate that will incorporate the decision tool for active learning; (2) mentor students who will work across disciplines to understand all life-cycle stages and impact of photovoltaics deployment; (3) organize presentations on sustainability and PV energy; and (4) support and encourage diversity in PV and other energy sectors through organization of various events with the Michigan energy businesses and at conferences for PV scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
