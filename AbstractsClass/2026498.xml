<AbstractNarration>This project develops new technology to assist healthcare workers, thereby making healthcare&lt;br/&gt;safer and more cost-effective. Healthcare is 18% of the Gross Domestic Product, yet errors annually&lt;br/&gt;lead to as many as 250,000 deaths and more than $500 billion in costs. The project is creating&lt;br/&gt;virtual assistants in intensive care and surgical units, which guide nurses and other healthcare&lt;br/&gt;workers, using worker input and experimental results to guide technology development. These&lt;br/&gt;virtual assistants give step-by-step guidance and feedback during complex tasks and monitor&lt;br/&gt;routine activities to make sure no steps are missed. Benefits include assistance in learning new&lt;br/&gt;activities, reducing stress, detecting possible problems, and automating some of the work providers&lt;br/&gt;do now to document their ongoing activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team is developing prototypes, experimental results, and effectiveness&lt;br/&gt;measurements in healthcare settings for virtual assistants, called “ambient intelligent monitors”&lt;br/&gt;(AIMs). The team includes computer scientists, electrical engineers, clinicians, behavioral&lt;br/&gt;scientists, and healthcare economists at Stanford hospitals, Intermountain hospitals, and&lt;br/&gt;Stanford’s Schools of Engineering, Business, and Medicine. Research goals include developing&lt;br/&gt;sensors, computing, and software for AIMs, discovering how clinical workers prefer to&lt;br/&gt;communicate with AIMs, and experimenting with work environments to maximize their value to&lt;br/&gt;patients, families, and clinicians. The project includes three cycles of research, covering hand&lt;br/&gt;hygiene, Intensive Care Unit care bundles, and laparoscopic surgery. Each cycle includes analysis,&lt;br/&gt;design, development, implementation in normal hospital care, and evaluation. The research is&lt;br/&gt;proceeding along four parallel tracks. One track is designed to develop hardware for capturing privacy-protected&lt;br/&gt;data on edge devices such as cameras, depth sensors, and microphones. A second&lt;br/&gt;track is for developing algorithms that discern success and failure in enacting intended clinician&lt;br/&gt;bedside activity. A third track is for obtaining healthcare worker input to develop preferred ways&lt;br/&gt;for AIMs to interact with people, such as providing verbal prompts, confirming observations&lt;br/&gt;made by sensors, and automatically updating medical records. A fourth track is for running&lt;br/&gt;experiments to measure the clinical, behavioral, operational, and economic impacts of the AIMs.&lt;br/&gt;By coupling the engineering research with real-world deployment and clinical studies, this research&lt;br/&gt;will create new knowledge that is unattainable in a purely technology-driven or purely&lt;br/&gt;observational investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
