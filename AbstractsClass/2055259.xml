<AbstractNarration>Many manufacturing sectors are incorporating new technologies to enhance their competitiveness and efficiency. As a result, significant skills gaps have emerged within advanced manufacturing industries. These industries need multi-functional engineering technicians who have both manufacturing and engineering skillsets. Such skills are embedded in mechatronics, an engineering discipline that integrates mechanical, electrical, and programmable engineering technologies.  Mirroring national trends, the Denver metropolitan area has seen a significant increase in the number of advanced manufacturing employers. This project aims to help meet this regional workforce need for qualified mechatronics technicians.  To do so, the project will update its current Associate of Applied Science in Mechatronics Engineering Technology to be more responsive to industry needs.  It will also launch new efforts to increase recruitment and success of students in this degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to improve the Mechatronics degree program and expand the number of students earning the degree and entering the regional workforce.  To do so, the project team will collaborate with its Business and Industry Leadership Team to guide experiential learning and align the curriculum more closely with industry needs.  It will expand access to the program by developing concurrent enrollment opportunities for high school students and recruiting from partnering workforce centers.  A new position called “Navigator” will lead recruitment efforts, as well as provide mechatronics students with advising, support, and career connections. The project team will use materials from the National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity to guide their recruitment and retention strategies. Recognizing the need for faculty to be leaders in this effort, the project will support faculty members to earn industry-recognized certifications in mechatronics and related fields. Results from the project’s evaluation will inform stakeholders in engineering, manufacturing, education, and the public. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
