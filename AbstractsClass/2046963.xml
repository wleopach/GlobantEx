<AbstractNarration>Current general-purpose speech enhancement systems employ large models trained from big datasets of audio signals which are too bulky to run on small personal devices. A personalized model can be a resource-efficient solution because it focuses on a particular user and a specific test environment for which a smaller model architecture can be good enough. However, training a personalized model requires clean voice data from the test-time user in advance, which are not always available because of the userâ€™s privacy concerns or problems with recording. This CAREER project develops machine-learning methods to achieve the personalization goal while requiring no or few data samples from the test-time users. Because the project achieves the personalization goal in a privacy-preserving and resource-efficient way, it is a step towards a more available and affordable use of artificial intelligence for all members of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project circumvents the lack of personal data in the context of personalized speech enhancement using no- and few-shot learning frameworks with help from adversarial and self-supervised learning. First, it verifies that a personalized system with reduced computational complexity can still compete with a generic model in speech enhancement performance. To this end, the training algorithm divides the potentially large model into multiple sub-modules, each of which handles a particular sub-problem (e.g., a particular user's utterance). If the sub-problems are defined to be mutually exclusive, the test-time inference can be made efficiently by using only the most suitable sub-module. Since the sub-module selection is done on noisy speech, it achieves personalization with no additional training on the test user's data. Second, the project explores a no-shot learning approach, in which the fundamental challenge lies in optimizing a machine learning model with no available target. To this end, an already-trained general-purpose model is fine-tuned for an unseen test environment using adversarial optimization. The third research topic handles the case when a small amount of user's clean speech is available, which falls in the category of few-shot learning. The project overcomes data shortage via a self-supervised learning method that learns effective features from noisy speech data, which are more available than the clean ones. That way, the model can be prepared for a subsequent fine-tuning step, which can be done with only a few clean user-specific speech utterances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
