<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Ohio University is acquiring a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight, mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) equipped with direct analysis in real time (DART) sources to support Professor Stephen Bergmeier and colleagues Eric Masson, Justin Holub, Amir Farnoud and Jessica White. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. MALDI TOF combines gentle ionization (ideal for producing intact ions of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, and other similarly sized species) with a detection mode that offers an excellent balance between sensitivity and accuracy across a wide mass range. This highly sensitive technique allows identification and determination of the structure of molecules. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and region. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students with this modern analytical technique. The MALDI-TOF-MS is also used in outreach activities involving students from Appalachian Ohio and faculty from a number of liberal arts colleges in southeast Ohio including: Marietta College, Shawnee State University and the University of Rio Grande.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the characterization of synthesized organic and medicinal compounds. The instrumentation is used for developing peptide-based ligands that modulate therapeutically-relevant signal transduction pathways in cells. In addition, it benefits the exploration of supramolecular chemistry using macrocycles of the curcubit[n]uril family and the use of inorganic compounds as photochemotherapeutics and their interactions with DNA. The mass spectrometer is used to understand mechanisms through which nanomaterials disrupt the plasma membrane and for measuring and imaging chemicals on solid surfaces. The MALDI spectrometer is also employed in studies of phenol-soluble modulins which have potential uses as antibiotics, and in screening synthetic or natural polymers, metal complexes, bacterial strains, complex carbohydrates and synthetic inorganic compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
