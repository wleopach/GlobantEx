<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Microelectronics have continued to push the limits of miniaturization in efforts to improve performance. Improvements in device performance have been enabled by the introduction of new materials within the current microelectronics architecture but gains may not continue and new paradigms for devices are needed. In addition to improved performance, improved energy efficiency is an important factor in newer generations of devices. In order to develop a more energy-efficient electronics platform, spintronics, based on the manipulation of electron spin (not charge), has been identified as a promising alternative to present day charge-based microelectronics. Of particular interest are spintronics based on pure spin current where power dissipation is minimized because the movement of charge is minimized. This project addresses the challenge of identifying and developing a new class of materials for efficient spin current propagation and detection. One class of promising materials is based on metal  oxide thin films of CaIrO3 and PdCoO2. The research involves the design, synthesis, and characterization of these thin films. Additional research activities include the training of undergraduate and graduate researchers, including underrepresented minorities, who are likely to find future employment in the information technology sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This integrated research and education program is focused on the development of a new class of conductors with high spin orbit coupling and high carrier mobility in 4d and 5d transition metal oxide thin films. Research activities include unique approaches to exploiting non-equilibrium processes to stabilize epitaxial iridate and Pd based oxide films. Synthesis of these films will be complemented with structural, electronic, and magnetic characterization of the films themselves and subsequent fabrication and characterization of spin current-based heterostructures composed of these films. This research is timely as it exploits recent development of iridate films and the recent increased understanding of spin current transport. These studies provide an avenue to large spin-to charge and charge-to-spin conversion necessary for spin current control and may enable a new type of spin current based microelectronics. Education aspects of this  project include the training of education opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and the development of an apprenticeship and modular materials physics curricular program for local high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
