<AbstractNarration>This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative:  National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center).  The focus of a spectrum research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum. Radio spectrum is a critical enabler of technological innovations in commercial wireless communications, national security, scientific research, and many other important areas. In recognition of radio spectrum's importance, the White House announced multiple Presidential Memorandums concerning spectrum over the past few years. In the most recent Memorandum, titled "Developing a sustainable spectrum strategy for Americaâ€™s future," the President directed the Department of Commerce to develop a long-term National Spectrum Strategy to prepare for deployment of next-generation wireless technologies and to enable more efficient utilization of spectrum. This project includes planning activities for a national SII-center that will serve as a premier nexus for spectrum-related research, education &amp; workforce development, and industry &amp; government engagement. Ultimately, the overarching aim of the center is closely aligned with that of the National Spectrum Strategy: maintaining the United States' position as a leader in spectrum technologies, while sparking innovation and economic growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is for planning activities for an envisioned center with three primary research priorities aligned with national priorities: (1) increase spectrum efficiency and agility; (2) enable near real-time spectrum awareness and automated spectrum decision making; and (3) enforcement and security, passive use protection, and safety of radio frequency emissions.  The team will carry out and promote research associated with spectrum flexibility and agility that will enable the use of multiple spectral bands, and novel multi-functional waveforms.  They will carry out and promote research that provides the ability to manage and access spectrum at a high-level of fidelity and fine granularity while maximizing automation.  And they will carry out and promote research that advances the state-of-the-art in spectrum rule enforcement and incumbent user protection, with a particular focus on protecting passive users of spectrum. The envisioned center will carry out a wide range of activities that will have broader impacts on several fronts. First, the center's research agenda will advance the state-of-the-art in wireless technologies, and will enable fundamentally new technologies, methods, and policies that represent a significant step towards realizing a long-term, sustainable spectrum access framework. Through collaboration with the center's industry partners, such research activities will help the U.S. wireless industry maintain its leadership position. Second, the center's thrust on IP generation and involvement in the standards-setting landscape will aid the U.S. wireless industry's ongoing efforts to have greater influence on next generation wireless standards, especially those that directly dictate the equipment and devices that operate on standards-enabled networks. Third, the center's programs on education and workforce development will address the long-term workforce shortage problem in the U.S. by nurturing a diverse, globally competitive workforce that is well trained in spectrum-related technologies. Lastly, the center will significantly impact the interplay between spectrum stakeholders by acting as a key hub that enables substantive organizational collaborations and linkages between academia, industry, federal agencies, national labs, and other stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
