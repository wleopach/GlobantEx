<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is to improve new pumps for the satellite launch industry.  Small satellites support many applications such as global Internet and communication coverage, as well as earth and environmental imaging. The proposed technology will support propulsion systems with higher efficiency. This project will explore high-performing design and manufacturing techniques required to create a 3D printed, high-efficiency propulsion sub-system. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and adaptable by leveraging many advanced design and manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the research and development of the launch industry’s first commercially available turbine-driven pump system for the satellite launch industry. The innovation reduces typical turbopump cost and part count by a factor of 10, and can be rapidly configured to meet requirements for thrust, engine cycle, and propellant combinations. The proposed project will explore the cost-performance trade space for a novel rocket engine turbopump system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
