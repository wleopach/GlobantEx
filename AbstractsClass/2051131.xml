<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to University of California, Riverside Center for Plant Cell Biology (CEPCEB), located in Riverside, CA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2021 - 2023. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities and/or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The scientific focus addresses an urgent national need for training in the cell biology of plants and plant pathogens. Major emphasis will be given to the use of innovative experimental approaches driven by recent advances in genomics/chemistry-related analytical technology. Assessment of the program will be done using the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The demand for plant biologists is exponentially growing. The ever-increasing challenges of global food security and changing ecosystems, as well as future needs for innovative pharmaceuticals, sustainable raw materials and renewable energy require science-based solutions developed by experienced and well-trained plant biologists. Like nearly all other life-science disciplines, plant biology is experiencing a major shift towards innovative high-throughput technologies, such as Next-Generation DNA sequencing, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. In particular, the fields of plant epigenetics, metabolomics/metabolic engineering, cell biology, and translational biology have gained enormous significance. Key assets of this program include extensive experience in successful undergraduate research due to the 18-year history of this REU site, well-integrated infrastructure, and successful plant researchers with access to state-of-the-art genomics, bioinformatics, microscopy, metabolomics and proteomics core facilities. This REU provides authentic research experiences that also include opportunities for oral and written presentations, workshops on professional development, scientific reading, and other group activities. Application materials and more information about the program are available by visiting https://cepceb.ucr.edu/reu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Rasmussen at carolyn.rasmussen@ucr.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Eulgem at thomas.eulgem@ucr.edu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
