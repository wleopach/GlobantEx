<AbstractNarration>In 2018 and 2019, Cape Town underwent historic water shortages resulting from decreased rainfall and a ballooning population. Three other major coastal cities—Port Elizabeth, East London, and Durban—have also felt increased stress on their water supply and sanitation infrastructure, a growing issue thanks to climate change and underfunded infrastructural maintenance. This project responds to this crisis by exploring the history of water management and its relationship to public health in these four major port cities of British-occupied Cape Colony and Natal between 1850 and 1910. While scholars in public health and sociology have examined how municipal administrators and urban residents manage cities’ clean and wastewater, few have considered them together. This research establishes how both residents and governments construct ideas about how to control urban sanitation and water supply. Water is a valuable resource to understand municipal public health priorities because of its widespread necessity and increasing scarcity.  This project examines the relationship between municipal authorities and urban residents to illuminate the colonial legacies of water management and infrastructure in these cities. It aims to help those municipalities, among others, better understand the different perspectives and voices involved in clean and wastewater management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of this project are to reveal how municipal and resident actions come into conflict or cooperate with one another; explore how colonial municipalities and their residents use definitions of sanitary water in daily public health prevention; and demonstrate how and why the non-human environment complicates and influences sanitary engineering and infrastructure. The project addresses these goals by using historical methods to analyze documents from the Western Cape Archives and the UK National Archives, including correspondence, resident petitions, public health and nuisance inspector reports, municipal statutes, newspaper articles, and municipal committee reports. These sources uncover administrative and resident perspectives across the four cities that depict the day-to-day realities of water supply and management. In doing so, this project exposes the racial, class, and gendered interests and values driving water use and management. It deepens our understanding of public health by addressing how disease outbreaks and water shortages create the need for more efficient and better-maintained drainage and water delivery infrastructure. This is a pressing issue in postcolonial cities, where municipalities often continue to use infrastructure built under colonial governments and thus reckon with its legacies. The project expands on environmental studies by showing how the natural world—plants, animals, and other non-human phenomena—is constantly present in the decisions people make, particularly when it threatens elements like water that are necessary to a city’s existence. Ultimately, this research demonstrates that it takes cooperation and understanding between administrators and residents to recognize and redress disproportionate access and delivery of utilities to municipal inhabitants, particularly the most vulnerable members of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
