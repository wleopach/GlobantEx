<AbstractNarration>Humanity has long been fascinated by the majesty of the night sky.  Now, with powerful scientific tools, we can better observe stars, galaxies, and the universe itself.  We can also better understand the mechanisms behind this majesty.  Nuclear physics processes are especially important.  Stars are powered by fusion reactions, supernova explosions produce and disperse chemical elements, and the remnants of these explosions accelerate high-energy cosmic rays.  A better understanding of these nuclear processes would help us understand the origin, nature, and fate of the universe.  A way forward is possible using neutrinos, tiny particles with zero charge, almost no mass, and only weak interactions.  Neutrinos are abundantly produced in many astrophysical objects.  Detecting neutrinos is very difficult, but doing so can reveal physical conditions deep within these sources, beyond the reach of observations with light.  The PI will lead a broad program of theoretical work in neutrino astrophysics designed to lead to breakthroughs in understanding astrophysical objects and neutrino properties.  Junior scientists will be trained on cutting-edge research as well as career skills.  The PI and junior scientists will work to share results with the public and to broaden participation by under-represented groups, including the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project features three main thrusts: solar neutrinos, supernova neutrinos, and high-energy neutrinos.  The central tenet of this work is that a broad-based, tightly integrated, theory-led approach to neutrino astronomy can decisively advance nuclear astrophysics.  For solar neutrinos, long-term outcomes could include significantly reduced detector backgrounds and thus improvements in the precision of signals from existing detectors, along with a high-statistics solar-neutrino measurement in the DUNE detector.  For supernova neutrinos, these could include better observing a Milky Way supernova and the discovery of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB).  For high-energy neutrinos, these could include new detection techniques that facilitate the discovery of astrophysical neutrino sources.  All three thrusts will benefit from the addition of gadolinium to Super-Kamiokande in 2020, as originally proposed by Beacom and Vagins in 2003 to help separate signals from backgrounds.  Throughout, the PI will use the progress in neutrino astronomy to advance multi-messenger astrophysics and beyond-standard model physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the objectives of "Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
