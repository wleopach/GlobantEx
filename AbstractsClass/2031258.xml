<AbstractNarration>Although many states now mandate computer science (CS) / computational thinking (CT) integration into K-8 classrooms, there are still challenges to ensuring that all American students have access to CS education. This project focuses on two central challenges: teacher capacity to access and implement CS- and CT-integrated curricular materials, and equity in CS/CT learning opportunities for all students. In this project, CodeVA works in partnership with researchers from the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University, and two Virginia school districts, to develop and test a model to support elementary teachers in the development and ongoing adaptation of their own culturally relevant lesson plans that integrate CS and CT across core subjects (math, social studies, science, English language arts). Through a process of developing, testing and refining the model and resources, the project will develop the model and supporting “toolkit” resources: a Computer Science Integration Guide for teachers to use as part of their lesson planning process, the development of an online professional learning community, an integrated lesson library of over 200 teacher-created lessons, and exemplar videos that will be used to help teachers visualize integrated CS and CT instruction.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team uses a Design Based Implementation Research approach to refine the professional learning model, and collect qualitative and quantitative data, to investigate the impact of the professional learning experiences and the toolkit resources as well as what is needed to support the use and implementation of the tools. Research questions focus on how the project activities help teachers develop culturally relevant CS integrated lessons; how the teachers implement the lessons; the impact of the lessons on student learning and interest, and the impact of the project activities on teachers’ cultural competency, CS understanding and self-efficacy for teaching CS.  The project is informed by Culturally Relevant Teaching theory as well as the Knowledge Integration framework. In addition to the toolkit of resources for teachers, the project will share research findings with researchers and practitioners; create white papers to support school administrators; and develop policy briefs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
