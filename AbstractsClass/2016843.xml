<AbstractNarration>Kilo Moana is a 186 foot, general-purpose research vessel built in 2002 and operated by the University of Hawaii under a charter party agreement with the Office of Naval Research (ONR). The vessel is part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF) and is supported by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). Ship time is made available to academic researchers funded by the NSF, ONR, NOAA, NASA, and other federal and state agencies. In 2019, Kilo Moana had 286 funded days with 206 of them for NSF. In 2020, the vessel is scheduled to sail 236 days with 204 (86%) of them for NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Hawaii requests funds for the replacement the their eXpendable BathyTherograph (XBT) system.&lt;br/&gt;XBT Deck Unit $17,210 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A modern research vessel requires a variety of dedicated equipment to support investigations at sea.  The R/V Kilo Moana is a 185-foot general purpose research vessel. The vessel is owned by the Navy and operated by the University of Hawaii as part of the U.S. academic research fleet. Aboard the R/V Kilo Moana, this specialized equipment includes multibeam swath sonars that are used to map the seabed mapping in order to delineate geologic structures.  In order for these sonars to produce accurate maps, they must have refraction correction tables that correct for errors in the measured angle of received sonar beams.  These refraction correction tables are created by the sonar equipment by reading sound velocity profiles taken during the mapping activity.  The most efficient and cost-effective method of developing sound velocity profiles is to collect temperature profiles using expendable bathythermograph (XBT) probes and combine those data with existing ocean salinity databases.  This grant provided funds to purchase two Lockheed Martin Sippican LMC-16 XBT data acquisition units that have been installed aboard the R/V Kilo Moana.  These data acquisition units are able to acquire data from a variety of expendable probes, including XBTs, expendable sound velocity probes (XSV) and expendable conductivity/depth/temperature probes (XCTD).
