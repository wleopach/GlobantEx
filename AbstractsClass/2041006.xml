<AbstractNarration>As our nation faces new and persistent challenges, university faculty and administrators, higher education leaders, and disciplinary and professional societies are all grappling with the need to build skills to transform teaching and overall institutional practices in ways that are more inclusive and equitable. The Aspire Alliance, co-led by the Association of Public &amp; Land-grant Universities (APLU) and the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has created Aspire’s Inclusive Faculty Framework (IFF) which provides opportunities for higher education professionals to acquire skills through three domains: understanding identity, intercultural awareness, and relational competencies. These domains, and the knowledge, skills, and attitudes associated with them, comprise a transferable set of inclusive practices that are applicable across the many roles faculty play within their careers (e.g., instructor, advisor, mentor, colleague, leader).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Aspire Alliance will host six, 1.5-hour synchronous, online seminars and develop a facilitation guide that will support participants to create ongoing local initiatives to further explore diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in STEM. The Professional Development Series, will bring together topic experts, members of the broader NSF INCLUDES Network, other NSF initiatives, as well as disciplinary and professional societies, to build DEI capacity through a Community of Practice (CoP) model of regular interactions of people sharing a passion and learning together. This capacity building professional development approach has emerged from the development of Aspire’s Inclusive Faculty Framework (IFF). The IFF flips the traditional faculty development workshop model, which tends to focus on a single faculty role, to instead provide opportunities for higher education professionals to acquire skills framed in the context of understanding identity, intercultural concepts, and relationships applicable across all the roles faculty play in their careers. The series will begin in the Fall 2020 and conclude in Winter 2021.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
