<AbstractNarration>Paper-based electronics and sensors (i.e., Papertronics) are emerging technologies providing a new platform for a wide range of applications for healthcare, environment monitoring, display, and energy storage. Paper as a substrate for next-generation electronics holds significant potential because of its physical and chemical characteristics, including a high surface area to volume ratio, porous structure, biocompatibility, biodegradability, low-cost worldwide availability, foldability, and lightweight. However, the mechanical properties limit intimate integration and conformal contact with living organ systems because the paper is easy to tear and not stretchable. To advance papertronics into bio-integrated soft bioelectronics, paper’s mechanical properties will be modified to make it stretchable while keeping the fibrous structure with bioinert chemical properties to take full advantage of paper’s intrinsic characteristics. The stretchable paper, new material and platform, will be the foundations of the next generation of the papertronics and paperfluidics. Indeed, the stretchable paper can transform into a new domain of interdisciplinary studies putting together basic material science research and engineering sciences to establish groundbreaking innovations. The systematically studied fabrication parameters will accelerate the development of advanced manufacturing, especially in flexible hybrid electronics, and further will be transformed into the production process for use by industry. Knowledge will be disseminated through the development of an educational workshop for STEM teachers, peer-reviewed publications, classroom teaching, student mentoring, and full participation of minorities, women, and underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to revolutionize paper-based electronics by creating advances in the stretchable co-axial nonwoven fibrous mat using electrospinning technologies. The stretchable papers consist of thin, soft, and core-sheath fibrous platform that will allow becoming elastic but maintaining chemical properties of the paper while using silicone elastomer and cellulose for core material and outer sheath polymer, respectively. Our project involves three objectives to investigate stretchable papertronics. The specific aims are as follows: (1) the thin, nanomesh cellulose coated elastomeric silicone-based polymer substrates will be investigated for mechanically, and biochemically compatible bioelectronics; (2) the stretchable paper will be characterized its physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. The relationship between the fiber diameter and core (or sheath) thickness with processing parameters will be systematically studied. Additionally, the compatibility to the conventional printing technologies will be tested to develop the stretchable paper into functional electronics.; (3) the elastomeric paper-based microbial fuel cell (MFC) will be demonstrated as model papertronics. The 3D cellulose-coated PDMS nanofibers will serve as a substrate for MFC, which generates power for soft bioelectronics with conformal contact with the organ system. Overall, the study of the paper-based electronics validated with the stretchable paper will offer a comprehensive understanding of future developments in the biomechanically compatible papertronics and paperfluidics for inflammatory-free, long-term biomedical applications as well as the environment- and cost-friendly solutions in manufacturing and disposal engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
