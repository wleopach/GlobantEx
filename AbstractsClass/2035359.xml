<AbstractNarration>The COVID-19 pandemic has exponentially accelerated the growth of online educational technology. Digital platforms are seeing a 10 fold increase in users. Still, many current educational technologies have weak approaches to instruction, and they do not leverage basic research on learning, have a culture of continuous improvement, meet the needs of diverse learners, or leverage the growing power of &lt;br/&gt;computers. This conference will provide ideas for deliverables around potential use-cases and prototypes as well as lay the groundwork for future collaborations across a variety of disciplines to research, develop, and refine effective and equitable remote educational technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring together experts in industry and fields such as education, cognitive science, and technology to identify barriers and solutions to delivering high-quality online education. These collaborations will inform best practices in educational technology design and generate future development and testing. Topics such leveraging AI/ML or new modes of platform design will be key components of the discussions that take place at this conference, along with a look at what types deliverables can be derived from applying these new approaches to online learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
