<AbstractNarration>The Earth is a complex system, with myriad interactions and feedbacks among the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and the individuals, institutions, and technologies that respond to and influence these dynamics. Many pressing societal concerns -- such as ensuring a fresh water supply, responding to natural disasters, and retreating from sea level rise -- involve multiple processes that interact in dynamic and often nonlinear ways. A systems-based approach to understanding our planet can help guide responses to these societal concerns. This award provides funds for a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study to develop a consensus report with a compelling vision for a systems approach to studying the Earth and discussion of the facilities, infrastructure, coordinating mechanisms, computing, and workforce development needed to support that vision. It will assist several National Science Foundation directorates (including Geosciences, Biology, Engineering, Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Education and Human Resources, and Social, Behavioral, and Economics Sciences) in building bridges across disciplines to significantly advance a systems-level, integrated understanding of the Earth. The study will provide clarity about where future research on the Earth system can yield most benefit for the people and societies that depend on this information for their decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity will utilize the National Academies’ substantial experience and expertise in scientific community engagement and consensus building to develop the vision and explore mechanisms to leverage and align key facilities and programs. The work will be conducted by several Boards throughout the Divisions on Earth and Life Studies, Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Engineering and Physical Sciences, and Policy and Global Affairs. Portions of the work will be conducted in parallel “workstreams” that will leverage the existing network of expert advisory groups in place at the National Academies. An ad hoc committee of volunteer experts will work with an experienced staff team to conduct background research, encourage community engagement, and prepare report text. The committee and staff will solicit input from across Earth science communities, by means of an in-person workshop, virtual mini-workshops on specific topics, interviews with key NSF contacts and other stakeholders, online requests for input, and the use of electronic communications and networks. With significant engagement of diverse expert and decision maker communities throughout the study, the project will build new connections and capacity for advancing and applying knowledge of the Earth system. The peer-reviewed report will be disseminated widely through briefings, on-line discussions, webinars, presentations and sessions at relevant conferences, and other related activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
