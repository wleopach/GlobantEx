<AbstractNarration>This award supports student and postdoctoral fellow attendance at the&lt;br/&gt;SIAM-ACM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), to take place during &lt;br/&gt;January 5-8, 2020 in Salt Lake City, Utah. SODA is one of the few     &lt;br/&gt;major conferences with broad coverage of Theory of Computing and &lt;br/&gt;Discrete Mathematics. SODA has a record of strongly encouraging &lt;br/&gt;participation by students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable &lt;br/&gt;educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and &lt;br/&gt;for the opportunities for networking that it provides. This award will &lt;br/&gt;provide partial support to about 20 students/postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
